### ACM SIGPLAN Stands with Those Who Promote Inclusivity

June 5, 2020 by [Jens Palsberg](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/)

In the United States, and throughout many regions around the world, 
current events have brought attention to the urgent need for equality and 
respect for all individuals.  ACM SIGPLAN reaffirms its commitment 
to fostering diversity and inclusion within the global 
computer science community together with the bigger ACM family.

As an international organization of nearly 100,000 professionals, 
ACM respects the essential worth of all people and firmly believes that 
diversity strengthens the scientific enterprise and society as a whole. 
ACM's Code of Professional Ethics embodies these principles, and 
our Diversity and Inclusion Council works to translate them into 
effective action.

ACM SIGPLAN is committed to creating an environment that welcomes 
new ideas and perspectives, and where hostility or other harmful behaviors 
are not tolerated.  As an organization, we stand with those 
who promote inclusivity.

This year, ACM SIGPLAN created CARES, an organization to listen to and help
people who experience discrimination in our field.  Recent events highlight
why such organizations matter more than ever.

Computing, including our corner of it, already suffers from radical and
deeply problematic disparities of representation. We unequivocally support
the right of individuals to speak up about their suffering and for their
rights, and condemn systemic racism and discrimination of any kind. We're
eager to work to educate ourselves and help others make at least this
little corner of the world a better place.
