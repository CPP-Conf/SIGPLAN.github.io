#### For general chairs

<p>
If you are a general chair of a SIGPLAN conference and are interested in working with SIGPLAN-AV, please email <script>document.write("<a href='"+atob("bWFpbHRvOnNpZ3BsYW4tYXZAZ29vZ2xlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbQ==")+"'>"+atob("c2lncGxhbi1hdkBnb29nbGVncm91cHMuY29t")+"</a>.")</script><noscript><img src="mail.png" border="0" height="28" width="240"><font face="Arial" size="3"><br>&nbsp;</font></noscript>

SIGPLAN owns enough hardware (laptops, cameras and microphones) which can be used to setup streaming and recording of upto 8 parallel co-located events.

It is advisable to include the AV team atleast 3 months in advance, ideally before the contract with the conference venue is finalized to enable smooth functioning.
