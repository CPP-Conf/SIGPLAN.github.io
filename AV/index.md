### About us

SIGPLAN-AV is a volunteer-led team that operates within SIGPLAN. Our goal is to centralize the efforts of finding innovative and cost effective ways to enable remote participation (hybridization of conferences) and record conference talks for archival. We are able to manage the entire pipeline --- from setting up the rooms pre-conference, to uploading the recorded content post-conference.

Every event we cover is available at no cost in the [ACM SIGPLAN YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@acmsigplan).

### For General Chairs

We manage enough equipment for recording and streaming up to 8 parallel events.
It is recommended to include the team at least 3 months in advance, before the contract with the conference venue is finalized to enable smooth functioning.

<p>
If you are a General Chair of a SIGPLAN-associated conference and are interested in working with SIGPLAN-AV, please email us at <script>document.write("<a href='"+atob("bWFpbHRvOnNpZ3BsYW4tYXZAZ29vZ2xlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbQ==")+"'>"+atob("c2lncGxhbi1hdkBnb29nbGVncm91cHMuY29t")+"</a>.")</script><noscript><img src="mail.png" border="0" height="28" width="240"><font face="Arial" size="3"><br>&nbsp;</font></noscript>
