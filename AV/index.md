#### For general chairs

If you are a general chair of a SIGPLAN conference and are interested in using SIGPLAN-AV please email <sigplan-av@googlegroups.com>.

SIGPLAN owns enough hardware (laptops, cameras and microphones) which can be used to setup streaming and recording of upto 8 parallel co-located events.

It is advisable to include the AV team atleast 3 months in advance, ideally before the contract with the conference venue is finalized to enable smooth functioning.
