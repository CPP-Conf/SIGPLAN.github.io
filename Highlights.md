title: "SIGPLAN Research Highlights"
---

Since 2008, SIGPLAN has selected papers from its sponsored conferences
that are of high quality and broad appeal.  These papers, called
SIGPLAN Research Highlights, are selected by a committee representing
SIGPLAN's major conferences and elected officials.  These papers are
also recommended for consideration for the
[CACM](http://cacm.acm.org/) Research Highlights section.

### Nomination Process

The committee considers nominated papers from two sources:

- **Committee**: The SIGPLAN Research Highlights Committee, working
  closely with the program chairs from the conferences they represent,
  will review and nominate papers from the conferences listed above
  for consideration by the full committee.

- **Community**: Any SIGPLAN member may nominate a paper appearing in
  a SIGPLAN conference. Authors may not nominate their own papers.

Nominations can be made at this [website](http://cacm.sigplan.org).


### SIGPLAN Research Highlights Papers


As of January 2018, 51 papers have been recognized by the SIGPLAN
Research Highlights committee, and 30 SIGPLAN papers have appeared in
CACM, 18 from the SIGPLAN committee and 12 that were solicited directly
by the CACM committee.  This [webpage](/Highlights/Papers) contains
the full list of papers.
