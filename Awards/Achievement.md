title: "Programming Languages Achievement Award"
---

Given by ACM SIGPLAN to recognize an individual (or individuals) who
has (have) made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of
programming languages. The contribution can be a single event or a
lifetime of achievement. The award includes a prize of $5,000. The
award is presented at SIGPLAN's [PLDI conference](/Conferences/PLDI)
the following June.

All questions about the Programming Languages Achievement Award should
be directed to the SIGPLAN Awards co-Chairs.

#### Nominations

Nominations can be submitted at any time using the Web form at
<https://awards.sigplan.org>.  Nominations submitted on or before
January 15th will be considered for that year’s award.  A nomination
for the Achievement Award that is not selected will remain in
consideration for a total of three years.

#### Committee

The recipients of the awards are selected by the SIGPLAN Awards
committee, which is constituted as follows.
* The Chair of the Awards committee shall be a member of the SIGPLAN
  Executive Committee (EC), and shall be appointed by the executive
  committee.
* The SIGPLAN EC Chair shall be an ex-officio member of the Awards
  committee.  If the SIGPLAN EC Chair is unable to serve, he or she
  may appoint another member of the SIGPLAN EC as a substitute.
* The steering committees of the major SIGPLAN Conferences, POPL,
  PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH, shall each appoint a member to the Awards
  Committee.

The current committee is:
* [Işil Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil), U Texas, Austin
  (Chair)
* [Jeff Foster](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/), Tufts U (ex-officio)
* [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/), Cornell
  University (POPL)
* [Cormac Flanagen](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/people/cormac), UC
  Santa Cruz (PLDI)
* [John Hughes](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/), Chalmers U of
  Technology (ICFP)
* [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/), CMU (SPLASH)

#### Conflicts of Interest

Because this award is intended to recognize persons of major
influence, it is likely that several members of the awards committee
may have worked with, or co-authored articles with, the nominees, and
may have a conflict of interest. The primary mechanism for handling
such conflicts will be to declare them to the committee; once so
declared, conflicts of interest shall not automatically prevent a
committee member from taking part in the selection process. However,
if a member of the committee, or the chair of the committee, feels
that the association of a committee member with a nominee would
interfere with impartial consideration of the nominees, that committee
member shall be absented from the relevant parts of the discussion. If
the same committee member has conflicts of interest with more than one
nominee, the Chair of the Awards Committee may ask the constituency
that appointed the committee member to select a replacement member.
