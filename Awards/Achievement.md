title: "Programming Languages Achievement Award"
---

Given by ACM SIGPLAN to recognize an individual (or individuals) who
has (have) made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of
Programming Languages. The contribution can be a single event or a
lifetime of achievement. The award includes a prize of $5,000. The
award is presented at SIGPLAN's [PLDI conference](/Conferences/PLDI)
the following June.

All questions about the Programming Languages Achievement Award should
be directed to the SIGPLAN Awards co-Chairs.

#### Nominations

Nominations can be submitted at any time using the Web form at
<https://awards.sigplan.org>.  Nominations submitted on or before
January 15th will be considered for award that year.  A nomination
for the Achievement Award that is not selected will remain in
consideration for a total of three years.

#### Committee

Award recipients are selected by a committee constituted as follows:
* The Chair of the committee shall be a member of the SIGPLAN
  Executive Committee (EC), and shall be appointed by the executive
  committee.
* The SIGPLAN EC Chair shall be an ex-officio member of the committee.
  If the SIGPLAN EC Chair is unable to serve, he or she may appoint
  another member of the SIGPLAN EC as a substitute.
* The steering committees of the major SIGPLAN Conferences, POPL,
  PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH, shall each appoint a member to the
  committee.

The current committee is:
* [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html), Cornell U (Chair)
* [Andrew Myers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/), Cornell U (ex-officio)
* [IÅŸil Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil), U Texas, Austin (PLDI)
* [Amal Ahmed](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/amal/), Northeastern U (POPL)
* [Sukyoung Ryu](https://plrg.kaist.ac.kr/ryu), KAIST (ICFP)
* [Eliot Moss](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~moss/), MIT (SPLASH)

#### Conflicts of Interest

Because this award is intended to recognize persons of major
influence, it is likely that several members of the committee may have
worked with, or co-authored articles with, the nominees, and may have
a conflict of interest. The primary mechanism for handling such
conflicts will be to declare them to the committee; once so declared,
conflicts of interest shall not automatically prevent a committee
member from taking part in the selection process. However, if a member
of the committee, or the chair of the committee, feels that the
association of a committee member with a nominee would interfere with
impartial consideration of the nominees, that conflicted member shall
be absented from the relevant parts of the discussion. If a committee
member has conflicts of interest with more than one nominee, the Chair
of the Committee may ask the constituency that appointed the committee
member to select a replacement member.  The SIGPLAN EC Chair will
adjudicate as necessary.
