title: "Distinguished Service Award"
---

Given by ACM SIGPLAN to recognize the value and degree of services to the
Programming Languages Community. The award recognizes contributions to ACM
SIGPLAN, its conferences, publications, or its local activities. The award
includes a prize of $2,500.

We define contributions in the broadest sense. In particular we wish to recognize:

- Pedagogy about programming languages
- Pedagogy using novel programming languages ideas
- Pedagogy as broadly construed:
  - both curriculum and delivery
  - classroom (school, undergraduate, graduate)
  - on-line courses
  - on-line blogs/videos, etc.

**Selection Committee**  
The Award Committee will consist of a chair who is a member of the SIGPLAN
Executive Committee and members who are selected by the chair and approved by
the SIGPLAN Executive Committee. The SIGPLAN chair is an ex officio member of
the committee and shall adjudicate conflicts of interest, appointing substitutes
to the committee as necessary.


**Nominations**  

Please use <http://awards.sigplan.org/> to submit nominations.  Nominations
submitted by **January 5th** will be considered for that year's award.  A
nomination for the distinguished educator award that is not awarded will remain
under consideration for 3 years. This means that an otherwise strong nominee is
not blocked if they happen to be nominated at the same time as a truly
outstanding one. Conversely, if no nominee is strong enough, then there should
be no award.

Each nomination should consist of the following items:

- Name, address, phone number, and email address of the person making the
nomination (the nominator).
- Name, address, phone number, email address, and web site address of the
candidate for whom an award is recommended (the nominee).
- A short statement (400-1000 words) explaining why the nominee deserves the
award in question. This should include any information about the context of the
work to help the Award Committee understand its significance.
- Names and email addresses of 5-10 people who the nominator believes will
support the nomination. The awards committee will ask at least three of these
people for their opinions.

The candidate may be nominated simultaneously for other awards, such as the ACM
Karl V.  Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.
