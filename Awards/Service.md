title: "Distinguished Service Award"
---

Given by ACM SIGPLAN to recognize distinguished service contributions
to the Programming Languages Community. The award recognizes
contributions to ACM SIGPLAN, its conferences, publications, or its
local activities. The award includes a prize of $2,500. Current
members of the ACM SIGPLAN Executive Committee are not eligible for
this award.

All questions about the Distinguished Service Award should be directed
to the SIGPLAN Awards co-Chairs.

#### Nominations

Please submit nominations using the Web form at
<https://awards.sigplan.org/>.  Nominations submitted on or before
January 15th will be considered for award that year.  A nomination for
the Distinguished Service Award that is not selected will remain in
consideration for three years.

Each nomination should consist of the following items:

-   Name, affiliation, phone number, and email address of the candidate
    for whom an award is recommended (the nominee).
-   Name, affiliation, phone number, and email address of the person
    making the nomination (the nominator).
-   A short statement (200-500 words) explaining why the nominee
    deserves the award.
-   Names and email addresses of 5-10 people who the nominator
    believes will support the nomination. The awards committee will
    ask at least three of these people for their opinions.

#### Committee

Award recipients are selected by a committee constituted as follows:
* The Chair of the committee shall be a member of the SIGPLAN
  Executive Committee (EC), and shall be appointed by the executive
  committee.
* The SIGPLAN EC Chair shall be an ex-officio member of the committee.
  If the SIGPLAN EC Chair is unable to serve, he or she may appoint
  another member of the SIGPLAN EC as a substitute.
* The steering committees of the major SIGPLAN Conferences, POPL,
  PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH, shall each appoint a member to the
  committee.

The current committee comprises:*
* [Tony Hosking](https://cs.anu.edu.au/tony-hosking/), Australian
  National U (Chair)
* [Jeff Foster](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/), Tufts U
  (ex-officio)
* [Kathleen
  Fisher](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~kfisher/Kathleen_Fisher/Home.html),
  Tufts U
* [Steve Blackburn](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/steve-blackburn),
  Australian National U (PLDI)

  (ICFP)

  Miller](https://isr.scs.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/miller-heather.html),
  CMU (SPLASH)

#### Conflicts of Interest

If any member of the committee has a conflict of interest with a given
nominee they shall declare that to the committee; once so declared,
conflicts of interest shall not automatically prevent a committee
member from taking part in the selection process. However, if a member
of the committee, or the chair of the committee, feels that the
association of a committee member with a nominee would interfere with
impartial consideration of the nominees, that conflicted member shall
be absented from the relevant parts of the discussion. If a committee
member has conflicts of interest with more than one nominee, the Chair
of the Committee may ask the constituency that appointed the committee
member to select a replacement member.  The SIGPLAN EC Chair will
adjudicate as necessary.
