**About**

This award recognizes the contributions to computer science that John
C. Reynolds made during his life. It is a renaming of the SIGPLAN
Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award to encourage the clarity and
rigor that Reynolds embodied and at the same time provide a reminder
of Reynolds's legacy and the difference a person can make in the field
of programming language research.

{% comment %}

Reynolds is renowned for his many technical contributions.

 * Gedanken, a core untyped language mixing functional and imperative features, which influenced Scheme;
 * Defunctionalization, which gives principled ways of constructing compilers;
 * Polymorphic λ-calculus, a fundamental calculus of polymorphic functions, which influenced Java and C# generics;
 * Syntactic control of interference, a resource-oriented type system, which prefigured linear logic;
 * λ-calculus with subtypes, which is a foundational component of object-oriented type systems;
 * Idealized Algol, a core typed language for mixing imperative and functional features, which prefigured monads in Haskell;
 * Possible-world semantics for local state, a widely-used technique in programming language theory;
 * Relational parametricity, a fundamental theory of data abstraction;
 * Separation logic, an extension of Hoare logic to mutable data structures, which forms the basis of a new generation of proof tools.

Reynolds was an inspiration to all he worked with. He was well known
for helping colleagues and students work through ideas. But his
influence went well beyond his immediate circle; many researchers who
never worked with Reynolds nevertheless built on his ideas.
