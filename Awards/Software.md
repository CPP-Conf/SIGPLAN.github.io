title: "Programming Languages Software Award"
---
Given by ACM SIGPLAN to an institution or individual(s) to
recognize the development a software system that has had a
significant impact on programming language research,
implementations, and tools. The impact may be reflected in the
wide-spread adoption of the system or its underlying concepts by
the wider programming language community either in research
projects, in the open-source community, or commercially. The award
includes a prize of $2,500. The award is presented at SIGPLAN's
[PLDI conference](/Conferences/PLDI) the following June.
