SIGPLAN understands the importance of mentoring in the programming languages community
for broadening participation, improving retention, and building a healthy community.
SIGPLAN has two mentoring initiatives: the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop
([PLMW](/Conferences/PLMW)) and the Long-Term Mentoring Committee ([SIGPLAN-M](LongTermMentoring)).
