title: "SIGPLAN CACM Research Highlights Nomination"
---
### Background

In 2007, the *Communications of the ACM* underwent a significant
redesign, part of which was to introduce &#8220;Research Highlights&#8221;
papers. Moshe Vardi, the CACM Editor in Chief describes the process
by which CACM was redesigned and the goals of the Research
Highlights track here:
[http://cacm.acm.org/moshe-vardi](http://cacm.acm.org/moshe-vardi).

Here is his description of the Research Highlights track:

> &#8220;**Research Highlights**: The goal is to bring research articles,
> covering the broad spectrum of computing research, back to CACM.
> This will be a combined effort of conference and program chairs
> (ACM as well as non-ACM) and the CACM editorial board to select the
> best research material coming out of conferences and share that
> information with the wide readership of CACM. Each selected
> research paper will be adapted to the broad CACM readership and
> will be preceded by a short "Technical Perspective," giving readers
> an overview of the important points and significance of the
> research. These perspectives will be written by noted experts in
> the field.&#8221;

### Nominated Papers

Because being nominated for inclusion in the CACM is itself an
honor, the committee will record its nomination decisions in a list
that is updated on an on-going basis. The current list of nominated
papers is available [here](Newsletters/CACM/Papers).

### SIGPLAN CACM Nomination Committee

The SIG groups were asked to put a process in place to nominate
papers from their conferences as potential candidates for
publication in CACM. In 2008, SIGPLAN proposed a process by which
SIGPLAN would nominate such papers which was subsequently approved
by the CACM EIC (the complete proposal is available
[here](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/CACM-nominating-committee-proposal.pdf)).

For this purpose, the CACM Nomination Committee has been formed. As
described in the proposal, this committee will meet approximately 3
times per year to consider candidate papers and recommend some for
inclusion in CACM. Membership of the committee rotates with the
current membership listed below. Note that the SIGPLAN committee
only recommends papers to the CACM. Final editorial decisions about
which papers appear in CACM remains with the Research Highlights
subcommittee of the CACM editorial board
([http://cacm.acm.org/communications?pageIndex=5](http://cacm.acm.org/communications?pageIndex=5)).

Information about the review process that the committee will use is
included in the
[proposal](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/CACM-nominating-committee-proposal.pdf).

### Nomination Process

Because SIGPLAN is blessed with an abundance of excellent
conferences and workshops, it is important that we provide a
process where all appropriate papers can be considered for
nomination. There are two sources of nominations.

-   **Committee candidates**: The Nominating Committee composition
    is designed so that its members represent many SIGPLAN conferences.
    The committee members, working closely with the program chairs from
    the conferences they represent, will review and nominate papers
    from their conferences for consideration by the committee.
-   **Community candidates**: SIGPLAN members not on the committee
    may ask for papers to be considered by submitting a nominating
    proposal to the committee. The proposal should summarize the
    contribution of the paper and explain why the paper is suitable for
    inclusion in CACM. Such a nominating proposal should be no more
    than a page in length. Authors may not self-nominate.

SIGPLAN has established a web site to facilitate the submission of
such nomination. To nominate a paper please use the
[nomination website](http://cacm.sigplan.org).
