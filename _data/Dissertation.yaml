    Soundness is at the core of most PL verification techniques and random testing is a commonly 
    used technique for analyzing software. Developing a theory of soundness for random testing 
    is thus very important, but very few results existed before this thesis. Randomized techniques 
    are seldom used in (sound) program analyses; hence, addressing the problem requires the 
    development of new ways to approaching it. Filip's thesis is among the first to apply deep 
    techniques from randomized algorithms and combinatorics understanding and explaining the 
    effectiveness of random testing. In turn, the theory helps with the design of new random 
    testing approaches. The thesis adresses a hard problem brining in novel theory and proving 
    hard theorems. When we see a phenomenon that we cannot immediately explain (in this case that 
    random testing is so effective), we should try to build a scientific explanation. For some 
    problems, including random testing, it is unclear that one can actually formulate a precise 
    theory, because the "real world" is extremely messy. The fact that Filip is able to formulate 
    the problem precisely and prove nontrivial theorems about them is surprising and opens the 
    door to a new field.

    Ryan Beckett's thesis addresses the highly relevant topic of ensuring the correctness of 
    computer network configurations. Computer networks connect key components of the world's 
    critical infrastructure - their misconfiguration may have severe consequences for our society. 
    While the problems Ryan considers are from the networking community, the methods that he 
    uses to solve them are drawn from the programming languages and formal methods communities, 
    including declarative languages, automata, logic, compilers, bisimulation, static analysis, 
    abstraction. Using these methods Ryan thesis describes new principles, algorithms, and tools 
    for both verification and synthesis of network control plane algorithms.
    
    On the verification side, Ryan's key insight is that one can characterize the fixed points 
    to which routing algorithms converge. By carefully representing the constraints that define 
    such fixed points as SMT formula, he developed the world's most general and efficient control 
    plane verification engine. To further speed up verification, he defined clever new algorithms 
    capable of computing small, abstract networks that are behaviorally equivalent to much larger 
    ones. On the synthesis side, Ryan defines a new programming language called Propane for specifying 
    network control plane behavior. The work demonstrates that it takes just 50 lines of code in 
    the right high-level programming language (as opposed to 1000s of lines of configuration, per 
    device, for hundreds of separate devices) to specify core network requirements that are compiled 
    to industry-standard devices. Ryan also defines new analyses that guarantee correctness in the 
    presence of device failures.
    
    Ryan's results have been published in top programming languages and networking conferences. While 
    all aspects of the work could easily have been submitted to programming languages or formal methods
    venues, submitting his work to networking conferences has certainly maximized his impact in his 
    domain of study. Most notably, his work on the Propane language won the best paper award at SIGCOMM 
    in 2016.  With his thesis, Ryan Beckett has demonstrated his capability to conduct truly 
    interdisciplinary research of the highest scientific quality: The results were possible only with a 
    deep knowledge across the programming languages, formal methods and networking domains. Moreover, 
    the thesis is an excellent witness of the profound impact that programming language and formal 
    reasoning methods can have on other research areas.

  Advisor: Benjamin C. Pierce and Aaron Roth
  Citation: |
    The thesis explores and generalizes the COUPLING proof technique, for
    establishing properties of randomized algorithms. A correspondence between
    two different probabilistic programs (or two runs of the same program)
    requires the specification of the c orrelation between corresponding pairs
    of random draws and then extending this coupling on samples to a coupling on
    the resulting output distributions, which can then be used to establish the
    desired property on the programs. As Probabilistic Relation al Hoare Logic
    has just the right structure to be able to formally encode these coupling
    arguments, the thesis analyzes the structure of these arguments through this
    formal lens, justifying the attractiveness of the coupling approach in terms
    of compo sitionality.  It then considers an enriched logic and its
    connection to approximate couplings, which in turn are directly connected to
    differential privacy.  Working in this logic, it gives novel proofs of some
    key constructions from differential priv acy, including the exponential and
    sparse vector mechanisms. The proof for sparse vector is the first ever to
    be carried out in a machine-checkable form.

    Taken together, these results constitute a significant advance in our
    ability to mechanize key properties of important randomized algorithms such
    as those found in the differential privacy literature.

  Advisor: Santosh Nagarakatte
  Citation: |
    This thesis proposes abstractions and formal tools to develop correct LLVM
    peephole optimizations. A domain specific language (DSL) Alive enables the
    specification and verification of peephole optimizations. An Alive
    transformation is shown to be correct automatically by encoding the
    transformation and correctness criteria as constraints in first-order logic,
    which are automatically checked for validity using an SMT solver. It then
    generates C++ code for an LLVM pass. Peephole optimizations in LLVM are
    executed numerous times until no optimization is applicable and one
    optimization could undo the effect of the other resulting in non-terminating
    compilation. A novel algorithm based on directed-acyclic-graph (DAG)
    composition determines whether such non-termination bugs can occur with a
    suite of peephole optimizations. The Alive toolkit can generate concrete
    input to demonstrate non-termination as well as automatically generating
    weakest preconditions. It is actively used by the LLVM community and has
    detected numerous bugs in existing passes and is preventing bugs from being
    added to the compiler.

  Advisor: Mike Gordon and Magnus Myreen
  Citation: |
    This thesis establishes end-to-end verification with a
    comprehensive chain of connections all the way from the semantics
    of a theorem prover expressed in set theory down to x86 machine
    code running it. It also makes striking use of self-application
    for both the compiler and the theorem prover.  The "CakeML"
    compiler is compiled with itself. But more than that: it is
    formally proved correct, and the core of the theorem prover used
    to prove its correctness is also compiled using CakeML and
    formally verified using itself. Not only is this a compelling
    demonstration of the possibilities for formally correct software,
    and the promise of the CakeML system as an enabling technology for
    it, but gives perhaps the first really convincing correctness
    proof for the core of a higher-order logic interactive theorem
    prover. It is possible that this combination of theorem prover and
    formally verified path to machine code will become one of the
    primary platforms for developing high-assurance software.

  Citation: |
    This thesis proposes a new solution for the problem of concurrent
    program verification introducing the use of explicitly parallel
    models and logics to represent and reason about concurrent
    programs. An effective way of finding a sweet spot in the
    cost-precision spectrum is provided, weaving together the two
    steps of constraint generation and cons traint resolution,
    offering a new way to think about proofs of concurrent programs.
    This paradigm shift has been missing in the space of "automated"
    program verification of infinite-state programs, since despite the
    absolute elegance of Owicki-Gries and Rely-Guarantee proof
    techniques, the completeness of these techniques heavily relies on
    the concept of auxiliary proof state. In this thesis, "inductive
    data flow graphs" (iDFG) offer the same completeness and elegance
    as the Owicki-Gries method minus the need for the auxiliary state
    in generating provably "compact" proof arguments.  The elegance of
    iDFGs are generalized into a proof method "proof spaces" for
    concurrent programs with "unboundedly" many threads.

  Citation: |
    Automated verification of imperative data structures such as lists
    is challenging because of the need to define complex loop
    invariants that have a sensible interpretation in an underlying
    program logic.  This thesis presents a number of foundational
    results that greatly simplify the proof obligations that must be
    provided by the programmer for the verification of such programs.
    Through the introduction and application of concepts such as
    deterministic transitive closure and property-directed
    reachability, the thesis demonstrates the feasibility of using a
    decidable logic (EPR) as an effective basis for answering
    reachability queries on an expressive class of imperative
    list-manipulating programs.  The thesis also extends these
    foundational ideas to define modular principles for reasoning
    about imperative data structures across procedure boundaries.
    These contributions ultimately lead to a system that can
    effectively infer loop invariants from an expressive template
    family using existing SAT solver and shape analysis technology.
    Collectively, these results lead to a thesis that makes very
    important foundational and practical contributions to our
    understanding of the potential of automated program verification
    and its application to real-world programs.

  Advisor: Stephanie Weirich
  Citation: |
    This work represents a major step toward the holy grail of
    "general-purpose dependently typed programming" -- i.e., the
    design of programming languages that allow programs to be written
    using the full spectrum of standard features and idioms while,
    supporting machine-checked correctness proofs for these programs,
    expressed in the very same language. Such languages, combining the
    logical power of full-spectrum dependent languages such as Coq and
    Agda with the convenience and expressiveness of mainstream
    functional languages and supporting "lightweight verification"
    targeting just the most important properties of the most critical
    parts of the code, have been imagined for decades, but realizing
    this dream has proved technically challenging. The language and
    its accompanying metatheory introduce two important
    innovations. The first, and more technical, of these is the design
    of a core language combining a call-by-value evaluation order, a
    pragmatically motivated treatment of computational irrelevance (to
    support compilation to efficient machine code), and a novel
    treatment of propositional equality. The second is a new approach
    to surface-language design, where two terms (including proof
    terms) are considered to be equivalent if one can be rewritten to
    the other by applying a set of "known equalities" arising from
    previous definitions, which is quite convenient and intuitive for
    programmers. This beautiful thesis will be a cornerstone of a new
    generation of language designs supporting significantly more
    robust and reliable software development.

    Mark Batty's dissertation makes significant contributions to the
    understanding of memory models for C and C++.  The ISO C++
    committee proposed a design for C and C++ concurrency that was not
    up to the task of capturing a realistic relaxed-memory concurrency
    model. Batty's work uncovered a number of subtle and serious flaws
    in the design, and produced an improved design in completely
    rigorous and machine-checked mathematics. Using software tools to
    explore the consequences of the design, derived directly from the
    mathematics, it showed that it has the desired behavior on many
    examples, and developed mechanized proofs that the design meets
    some of the original goals, showing that for programs in various
    subsets of the language one can reason in simpler models. The
    standards committee have adopted this work in their C11, C++11,
    and C++14 standards. The members of the award committee were

  Citation: |
    Aaron Turon's dissertation makes several major contributions to
    the design, implementation, and verification of scalable
    concurrent programs.  First, the dissertation presents "reagents",
    a high-level language of combinators for designing---and
    *composing*---lock-free data structures.  Second, the dissertation
    shows how lock-free data structures can be used to scalably
    implement Fournet and Gonthier's join calculus, in a newly
    re-engineered C# library that significantly outperforms prior
    lock-based implementations.  Third, the dissertation develops
    powerful theoretical foundations---based on logical relations and
    separation logic---for verifying the correctness of scalable
    concurrent algorithms via contextual refinement.  The members of
    the award committee were impressed with both the breadth and depth
    of the work, as well as the elegance of the exposition.

  Citation: |
    Patrick Rondon’s dissertation makes several significant
    contributions to the field of automatic program verification.  It
    takes a type system -- a highly scalable yet not quite precise
    method of dealing with programs -- and refines it using
    Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) techniques to compensate for
    the precision loss.  There are implementations for both OCaml and
    C.  The achieved degree of effectiveness and automation is
    astonishing: programs that are beyond the existing verification
    tools can be handled fully automatically within seconds.  It
    demonstrates that formal verification can yield significant
    reliability guarantees for mainstream software engineering, at a
    reasonable cost.  In addition, the thesis contains a comprehensive
    formalization with very detailed, readable proofs.  The members of
    the award committee were impressed by the quality of the work and
    the clarity of the presentation.

    This dissertation addresses the problem of obtaining reliable
    results from concurrent programs. As a first step, the
    dissertation presents LiteRace, which uses sampling to dynamically
    detect race conditions. As a second step, the dissertation
    presents DRFx, which is a memory model that enforces sequential
    consistency, where hardware and software share responsibility for
    detecting violations of sequential consistency. Finally, the
    dissertation presents the design of an optimizing compiler that
    preserves sequential consistency. The dissertation thus
    demonstrates how a revised distribution of responsibilities among
    programmers, programming languages, and hardware can help detect
    and avoid concurrency violations. The committee was impressed with
    the dissertation's broad vision for both the problems of
    concurrency and the possible solutions.

    This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
    field of parallel and concurrent programming. The main technical
    contribution is a type and effect system that enables reasoning
    about non-interference at a fine granularity. A second
    contribution is support for non-deterministic code sections that
    are explicitly marked as such. A third contribution is support for
    object-oriented frameworks, where user extensions are guaranteed
    to adhere to the framework's effect restrictions. These
    contributions are backed by formal models, soundness proofs, and
    the Deterministic Parallel Java implementation. Evaluation shows
    that highly satisfactory speedups can be achieved on interesting
    code bases, sometimes beating the performance of hand-crafted
    implementations. The members of the award committee were impressed
