    Simplified Semantics and Debugging of Concurrent Programs via Targeted Race Detection
  Citation: |

    Advisor: Todd Millstein

    This dissertation addresses the problem of obtaining reliable
    results from concurrent programs. As a first step, the
    dissertation presents LiteRace, which uses sampling to dynamically
    detect race conditions. As a second step, the dissertation
    presents DRFx, which is a memory model that enforces sequential
    consistency, where hardware and software share responsibility for
    detecting violations of sequential consistency. Finally, the
    dissertation presents the design of an optimizing compiler that
    preserves sequential consistency. The dissertation thus
    demonstrates how a revised distribution of responsibilities among
    programmers, programming languages, and hardware can help detect
    and avoid concurrency violations. The committee was impressed with
    the dissertation's broad vision for both the problems of
    concurrency and the possible solutions.

    An Effect System and Language for Deterministic-by-Default Parallel Programming
  Citation: |
    Advisor: Vikram Adve

    This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
    field of parallel and concurrent programming. The main technical
    contribution is a type and effect system that enables reasoning
    about non-interference at a fine granularity. A second
    contribution is support for non-deterministic code sections that
    are explicitly marked as such. A third contribution is support for
    object-oriented frameworks, where user extensions are guaranteed
    to adhere to the framework's effect restrictions. These
    contributions are backed by formal models, soundness proofs, and
    the Deterministic Parallel Java implementation. Evaluation shows
    that highly satisfactory speedups can be achieved on interesting
    code bases, sometimes beating the performance of hand-crafted
    implementations. The members of the award committee were impressed
    by the quality of the work and the clarity of the presentation."
