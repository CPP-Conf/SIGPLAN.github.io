  Citation: |
    Le Botlan and Rémy's paper on MLF presented a major technical
    breakthrough in type inference for first-class
    polymorphism. Remarkably, by going from ML to a system that is
    more expressive than System F, principal types could be
    recovered. The paper was the first and only paper (to date) to
    present a type inference and unification algorithm with all the
    "good" features of ordinary ML inference and unification, except
    on a richer universe of types and constraints that allowed
    impredicative instantiation. The MLF system enjoys most general
    unifiers, completeness properties, and robustness under program
    transformations, with user type annotations providing the oracles
    needed to reach the expressiveness of System F and beyond. The MLF
    paper has been highly influential on subsequent work in type
    inference for first-class polymorphism, and is a must-read for
    anyone interested in the topic.

  Citation: |
    Assertion-based contracts have proven very useful for dynamically
    enforcing first-order program invariants in procedural languages,
    but until 2002 they had not been supported in languages with
    higher-order functions. Findler and Felleisen's paper filled this
    gap, presenting "the first assertion-based contract checker for
    languages with higher-order functions." The paper also spawned a
    great deal of follow-on work on such topics as the semantics of
    blame assignment and the integration of static typing and dynamic
    contract checking. Higher-order contracts have become a central
    component of the Racket (formerly PLT Scheme) system -- one of the
    major software artifacts of the functional-programming community
    -- which serves as both a research testbed and an effective tool
    for programming-language education.

  Citation: |
    Various attempts at extending ML modules with recursions were made
    starting in the early 90's. However, they all ran into a nasty typing
    issue later dubbed the "double-vision problem" by Derek Dreyer. Russo's
    ICFP 2001 paper was the first to propose a correct and practical solution
    to this problem. The solution played very cleverly on the nonstandard
    formalization of ML modules developed in his thesis. Building on this
    novel insight, the ICFP 2001 paper develops a complete design for
    recursive modules in ML, which Russo implemented in Moscow ML and which
    is complete enough to handle many desirable examples. Russo's design was
    the main source of inspiration for adding recursive modules in OCaml,
    taking recursive modules from an open research issue to a realised
    language feature that simply works.

    (for 2000) [Quickcheck: a lightweight tool for random testing of Haskell programs](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/351240.351266)
  Citation:
    This paper presented a very simple but powerful system for testing
    Haskell programs that has had significant impact on the practice of
    debugging programs in Haskell. The paper describes a clever way to
    use type classes and monads to automatically generate random test
    data. QuickCheck has since become an extremely popular Haskell
    library that is widely used by programmers, and has been
    incorporated into many undergraduate courses in Haskell. The
    techniques described in the paper have spawned a significant body
    of follow-on work in test case generation. They have also been
    adapted to other languages, leading to their commercialisation for
    Erlang and C.

    (for 1999) [Haskell and XML: Generic combinators or type-based translation?](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/317636.317794),
  Citation: |
    Malcolm Wallace and Colin Runciman's 1999 ICFP paper "Haskell and
    XML: Generic combinators or type-based translation?" was one of the
    first papers to spell out the close connection between functional
    programming languages and XML. It described a typed correspondence
    between XML's document type definitions (DTD) and Haskell
    datatypes. This correspondence leads to a natural representation of
    XML data in functional languages and permits native functions to
    operate on this representation. The paper also describes a generic
    encoding of XML trees together with a combinator language for
    querying and transforming the XML. The paper led to a widespread
    awareness of the close connection between XML and functional
    programming and initiated a flurry of research on functional XML
    processing. Moreover,  
    the accompanying implementation was widely distributed as part of a
    CD with various XML tools, thus making an impact in the problem
    domain beyond the functional programming community: a perfect
    example of functional programming solving real world problems.

  Citation: |
    Lennart Augustsson's 1998 ICFP Paper &#8220;Cayenne: A language with
    dependent types&#8221; made dependently-typed programming accessible to
    non-type theorists. The language design was a bold one, both in its
    use of dependent types and in its adoption of an undecidable type
    system. Although the idea seemed quite radical at the time, it
    allowed future work to break out of the straight-jacket of
    decidable type systems. It also pointed the way towards the merger
    of programming languages and proof systems that we are starting to
    see today in languages such as Agda.

  Citation: |
    "Functional Reactive Animation" by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak was
    the first published paper on functional reactive programming. It
    described a collection of data types and functions that comprised
    an embedded domain-specific language called Fran for composing
    interactive, multi-media animations. The key abstractions were
    first-class behaviors and events. Intuitively, a behavior is a
    value that varies with continuous time while an event is a discrete
    counterpart including time-varying predicates. The idea of
    regarding the entire lifetime of a time-varying quantity as a
    single first-class value was new and very surprising at the time,
    but the paper made it seem simple and obvious. The insight in the
    paper led to a significant number of follow-on projects including
    FranTk, Fruit, Pidgets, FrTime, Frob, FRP, Frappe, Frag, Fvision,
    Yampa, Feris, and work on embodying financial contracts in
    functional terms.

  Citation: |
    Julia Lawall and Harry Mairson's 1996 ICFP paper "Optimality and
    inefficiency: What isn't a cost model of the lambda calculus?"
    exposed a fundamental problem with proposed algorithms for optimal
    reduction. Starting with Jean-Jacques L&#233;vy's seminal work in 1978,
    the goal of optimal reduction was to correctly normalize
    lambda-calculus terms without duplicating redexes. Various
    strategies were subsequently devised to realize optimal reduction,
    notably the solution of John Lamping at POPL 1990, then simplified
    and improved by Georges Gonthier, Mart&#237;n Abadi, and Jean-Jacques
    L&#233;vy at POPL 1992. Each solution used subtle bookkeeping mechanisms
    to control sharing.

    Lawall and Mairson showed that these bookkeeping mechanisms
    introduced a complexity and inefficiency of their own. They
    discovered terms that could be normalized in linear time, but whose
    bookkeeping costs required exponential time. They further showed
    that Frandsen and Sturtivant's cost model for lambda-calculus
    reduction, presented at FPCA 1991, needed to account for the size
    of intermediate terms, and that optimal-evaluation interpreters
    were at least exponentially slower than the proposed cost model.
    Lawall and Mairson concluded that the notion of optimality did not
    necessarily coincide with that of efficiency. As a consequence,
    different and possibly optimal evaluation strategies were still
    needed, as were more realistic cost models. Subsequent work in this
    area has focused on such cost models, on further analysis of the
    inherent complexity of optimal reduction, and on relaxing the
    optimality condition in exchange for lower bookkeeping overhead and
    greater overall efficiency.
