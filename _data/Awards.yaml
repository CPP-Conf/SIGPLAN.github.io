Software:
  Name: Programming Languages Software Award
  Recipients:
    2012: 
     Awardee: Jikes Research Virtual Machine (RVM)
     Citation: |

        The SIGPLAN Software Award for 2012 goes to the Jikes Research
        Virtual Machine (RVM), an open-source virtual computer
        implemented in the Java programming language, and capable of
        running programs written in Java and many other languages that
        compile to JVM bytecodes. The award nomination names 32
        contributors to the Jikes RVM project, but the project actually
        has more than double that number of contributors. Jikes RVM was
        the first Java-in-Java virtual machine and contains many
        innovations, especially on adaptive optimization and memory
        management.

        The high quality and modular design of Jikes has made it easy
        for researchers to develop, share, and compare advances in
        programming language implementation. The Jikes RVM core team
        has nurtured and supported a large community of researchers;
        this is witnessed by more than 200 papers, at least 40
        dissertations, close to 25 courses, and research at almost 100
        universities, that are based on the Jikes RVM.

         * Bowen Alpern
         * Matthew Arnold

    2011:
      Awardee: Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow for the Glasgow Haskell compiler
      Citation: |
        "Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow receive the SIGPLAN Software
        Award as the authors of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), which
        is the preeminent lazy functional programming system for industry,
        teaching, and research. GHC has not only provided a language
        implementation, but also established the whole paradigm of lazy
        functional programming and formed the foundation of a large and
        enthusiastic user community. GHC's flexibility has supported
        experimental research on programming language design in areas as
        diverse as monads, generalized algebraic data types, rank-N
        polymorphism, and software transactional memory. Indeed, a large
        share of the research on lazy functional programming in the last
        5-10 years has been carried out with GHC. Simultaneously, GHC's
        reliability and efficiency has encouraged commercial adoption, in
        the financial sector in institutions like Credit Suisse and
        Standard Chartered Bank, and for high assurance software in
        companies like Amgen, Eaton, and Galois.

        A measure of GHC's influence is the way that many of the ideas of
        purely functional, "typeful programming" have been carried into
        newer languages and language features. including C\#, F\#, Java
        Generics, LINQ, Perl 6, Python, and Visual Basic 9.0. Peyton Jones
        and Marlow have been visionary in the way that they have
        transitioned research into practice. They have been role models and
        leaders in creating the large and diverse Haskell community, and
        have made GHC an industrial-strength platform for commercial
        development as well as for research."

    2010: 
      Awardee: Chris Lattner for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
      Citation: |
        Chris Lattner receives the SIGPLAN Software Award as the author of
        the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, which has had a dramatic impact
        on our field. LLVM is being used extensively in both products and
        research, for traditional and non-traditional compiler problems,
        and for a diverse set of languages. LLVM has had a significant
        influence on academic research, not just in compilers but also in
        other areas, such as FPGA design tool. Many researchers cite the
        "elegance of LLVM's design" as one of the reasons for using LLVM.
        LLVM has also had an impact on industrial projects and products; it
        is used at major companies including Apple and Google. For example,
        LLVM is an integral part of Apple's software stack in Mac OS X.
        Furthermore, as with academic research, LLVM is finding its way
        into unexpected applications of compiler technology. In summary,
        LLVM has had an incredible impact on both industry and academia and
        its elegance has enabled it to be used for a wide range of
        applications."

Milner:
  Name: Robin Milner Young Researcher Award
  Recipients:
    2012: 
      Awardee: Shriram Krishnamurthi
      Citation: |
        The SIGPLAN 2012 Robin Milner Young Researcher Award goes to Shriram
        Krishnamurthi, a prolific researcher who brings programming language
        theory to bear in many other disciplines, thus exposing its
        foundational value. His research contributions range from type
        soundness proofs for Java and influential extensions thereof, through
        foundational aspects of web programming, to model-driven development
        and empirical studies. The most important aspects of Krishnamurthi's
        research are

         - that it cuts across multiple disciplines, including education,
           software engineering, formal methods and security, but always
           building on the firm ground of programming language theory;
         - its orientation towards practicality and applicability to standard
           platforms: programming systems for teaching, reactive web
           programming, executable JavaScript semantics, and analysis
           techniques for security policies;
         - that it has resulted not only in publications, but also in
           practical systems that are used in academia and industry; and
         - the clarity of its exposition and presentation.
         - Shriram is also an influential educator, reaching out beyond the
           university to infect school kids with algebraic thinking.

        In summary, Shriram is an extraordinarily broad researcher, making
        sustained contributions in important and exciting areas, with a
        commitment to education that is ensuring that his ideas have even
        broader impact.

POPL:
  Name: Most Influential POPL Paper Award

      Awardee: [David F Bacon, Perry Cheng, VT Rajan]

        (for 2003) [A real-time garbage collector with low overhead and consistent
        utilization](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=604155&CFID=186511822&CFTOKEN=35702610)
      Citation: |
        Languages with automatic memory management offer well-known advantages
        in terms of software engineering, but the use of garbage collection
        seemed for a long time to place such languages off-limits for hard
        real-time and embedded systems.  Indeed, prior to this highly
        influential paper, the existing approaches to real-time garbage
        collection suffered from a number of practical problems: a lack of
        hard bounds on pause times in the face of fragmentation or large data
        structures; high space overhead due to the use of copying collection
        to avoid fragmentation; and uneven mutator utilization due to the use
        of work-based scheduling algorithms.  Bacon, Cheng & Rajan's paper
        showed how to overcome all these problems in the design of a *real*
        real-time garbage collector for Java.  The collector, which was
        implemented and tested in the Jikes RVM, employed an impressive
        variety of techniques, such as time-based scheduling and "mostly
        non-moving" collection, in order to provide guaranteed pause times,
        consistent mutator utilization, and low space overhead.  In short, the
        paper marked a major advance toward the important goal of turning hard
        real-time garbage collection into a reality.
