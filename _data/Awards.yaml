    2012: 
     Awardee: Jikes Research Virtual Machine (RVM)
     Citation: |

        The SIGPLAN Software Award for 2012 goes to the Jikes Research
        Virtual Machine (RVM), an open-source virtual computer
        implemented in the Java programming language, and capable of
        running programs written in Java and many other languages that
        compile to JVM bytecodes. The award nomination names 32
        contributors to the Jikes RVM project, but the project actually
        has more than double that number of contributors. Jikes RVM was
        the first Java-in-Java virtual machine and contains many
        innovations, especially on adaptive optimization and memory
        management.

        The high quality and modular design of Jikes has made it easy
        for researchers to develop, share, and compare advances in
        programming language implementation. The Jikes RVM core team
        has nurtured and supported a large community of researchers;
        this is witnessed by more than 200 papers, at least 40
        dissertations, close to 25 courses, and research at almost 100
        universities, that are based on the Jikes RVM.

         * Bowen Alpern
         * Matthew Arnold

    2011:
      Awardee: Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow for the Glasgow Haskell compiler
      Citation: |
        "Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow receive the SIGPLAN Software
        Award as the authors of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), which
        is the preeminent lazy functional programming system for industry,
        teaching, and research. GHC has not only provided a language
        implementation, but also established the whole paradigm of lazy
        functional programming and formed the foundation of a large and
        enthusiastic user community. GHC's flexibility has supported
        experimental research on programming language design in areas as
        diverse as monads, generalized algebraic data types, rank-N
        polymorphism, and software transactional memory. Indeed, a large
        share of the research on lazy functional programming in the last
        5-10 years has been carried out with GHC. Simultaneously, GHC's
        reliability and efficiency has encouraged commercial adoption, in
        the financial sector in institutions like Credit Suisse and
        Standard Chartered Bank, and for high assurance software in
        companies like Amgen, Eaton, and Galois.

        A measure of GHC's influence is the way that many of the ideas of
        purely functional, "typeful programming" have been carried into
        newer languages and language features. including C\#, F\#, Java
        Generics, LINQ, Perl 6, Python, and Visual Basic 9.0. Peyton Jones
        and Marlow have been visionary in the way that they have
        transitioned research into practice. They have been role models and
        leaders in creating the large and diverse Haskell community, and
        have made GHC an industrial-strength platform for commercial
        development as well as for research."

    2010: 
      Awardee: Chris Lattner for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
      Citation: |
        Chris Lattner receives the SIGPLAN Software Award as the author of
        the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, which has had a dramatic impact
        on our field. LLVM is being used extensively in both products and
        research, for traditional and non-traditional compiler problems,
        and for a diverse set of languages. LLVM has had a significant
        influence on academic research, not just in compilers but also in
        other areas, such as FPGA design tool. Many researchers cite the
        "elegance of LLVM's design" as one of the reasons for using LLVM.
        LLVM has also had an impact on industrial projects and products; it
        is used at major companies including Apple and Google. For example,
        LLVM is an integral part of Apple's software stack in Mac OS X.
        Furthermore, as with academic research, LLVM is finding its way
        into unexpected applications of compiler technology. In summary,
        LLVM has had an incredible impact on both industry and academia and
        its elegance has enabled it to be used for a wide range of
        applications."
