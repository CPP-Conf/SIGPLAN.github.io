- Awardee: Martin Vechev
  Citation: |
    Martin Vechev is a prolific researcher who has made major contributions to 
    many areas of programming languages. He is a pioneer who is often one of 
    the first in the PL community to move into a new area. He is particularly 
    well known for his seminal papers and tools at the interface of programming 
    languages and machine learning. An example tool is JSNice, which deobfuscates 
    JavaScript code by learning a probabilistic graphical model from a large 
    corpus of programs, which is then used to predict improved variable names 
    and perform statistical type inference. Another example at this interface is 
    his work on using abstract interpretation for proving safety properties of 
    deep neural networks, such as robustness. His many other contributions include 
    significant advances in concurrent memory management, synthesis of 
    synchronization code for concurrent programs, and efficient program analysis.

- Awardee: Ranjit Jhala
  Citation: |
    Ranjit Jhala has demonstrated a long track-record of producing foundational
    and impactful contributions to our understanding of programming language
    theory and implementation. Jhala was one of the principal developers of the
    BLAST automatic verification tool for checking temporal safety properties of
    C programs. A key contribution was the notion of lazy abstraction which
    integrates three phases of the software model checking loop: abstraction,
    checking and refinement. Jhala developed an algorithm for model checking
    safety properties that continuously builds and refines a single abstract
    model on demand by the model checker. This allows different parts of the
    model to exhibit just the degrees of freedom required to verify a desired
    property. The work on lazy abstraction has proved to be very influential in
    the verification community. Jhala also used Craig interpolation to
    efficiently construct, from a given abstract error trace that cannot be
    concretized, a parsimonious abstraction that removes the trace. He developed
    the method for programs with arithmetic and pointer expressions, and
    call-by-value function calls. This resulting technique was successfully
    applied to programs over 130,000 lines which was previously not possible. 

    Jhala has significantly advanced the practical application of refinement
    types which allow programmers to attach additional specifications to
    existing types. These additional specifications allow interesting properties
    to be proved about code, such as invariants over recursively defined data
    structures. The problem with such specifications is that they can be too
    onerous to write down and get right. Jhala's work on Liquid Types showed
    that a useful and expressive class of these specifications can be inferred
    in a largely automatic way, making the approach far more practical at a
    reasonable cost. Jhala's work with Liquid Types has significantly extended
    the state-of-the-art, adding a notion of predictability and decidability
    often not found in SMT-based software verification, and extending the
    usability and expressiveness of formal type systems.

    Jhala has also worked on data race detection, information flow and timing
    analysis for Javascript and code analytics. Jhala has also written a lengthy
    tutorial on Liquid Haskell, proved to be an excellent communicator and
    mentor who has given many engaging and inspiring presentations, and served
    extensively on program committees of top conferences.

- Awardee: Derek Dreyer
  Citation: |
    Derek Dreyer has made deep, creative research contributions of
    great breadth. His areas of impact are as diverse as module
    systems, data abstraction in higher-order languages, mechanized
    proof systems and techniques, and concurrency models and
    semantics. He has refactored and generalized the complex module
    systems of SML and OCaml; devised logical relations and techniques
    that enabled advances in reasoning about higher-order imperative
    programs; and developed novel separation logics for modular
    verification of low-level concurrent programs. His research papers
    are a model of clarity and depth, and he has worked actively to
    translate his foundational ideas into practice – most recently
    with the RustBelt project to provide formal foundations for the
    Rust language. Additionally, Dreyer has contributed leadership,
    support, and mentorship in activities such as the PLMW series of
    workshops, which are instrumental in growing the next generation
    of PL researchers.

2016:
- Awardee: Stephanie Weirich
  Citation: |
    Stephanie Weirich has made deep and sustained contributions to
    programming language research in the areas of functional
    programming, dependent types, and proof assistants.  She has been
    one of the main investigators of type inference for Generalized
    Algebraic Data Types (GADTs), and, with collaborators at Microsoft
    Research, she helped put this technology into practice in the
    widely used GHC Haskell implementation.  Weirich, with
    collaborators at Penn and Cambridge, also initiated and led the
    POPLMark challenge, a highly visible and influential effort to
    promote the use of proof assistants for formalizing and checking
    the theory of programming languages.  She has also greatly
    contributed to the understanding of dependent types in practical
    programming languages, and is now involved in an effort to bring
    the benefits of dependent types to Haskell.  Finally, Weirich has
    made substantial contributions to the programming languages
    community, notably with her involvement in the Programming
    Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW), which has blossomed into a
    highly successful workshop that is held several times a year at
    venues including POPL, PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH; Weirich was one of
    the original organizers of PLMW at POPL 2012, and continues to
    serve on the workshop's steering committee.

2015:
- Awardee: David Walker
  Citation: |
    David Walker has made deep and varied contributions to programming
    language research, but always with an eye towards emerging and
    surprising applications of foundational theory.  He was one of the
    co-authors of the work on Typed Assembly Language (TAL), which
    showed how conventional type systems could be brought to bear on
    low-level machine code, and which forms the basis for today's
    typed virtual machines such as Microsoft's .NET.  Focusing on the
    need for better reasoning principles for pointers, he helped
    develop Alias Types, the Calculus of Capabilities, and
    region-based formalisms that influenced the design of type systems
    for modern languages like Cyclone, Vault, and Rust.  Walker also
    provided semantic foundations for secure program monitoring, and
    used his insights to develop new tools for enforcing security
    policies on legacy code.  Long before "big data" was a hot topic,
    he and his co-authors designed languages for processing large,
    ad-hoc data collections.  Recognizing trends in hardware, he
    developed new techniques for verifying the safety of programs
    executing on faulty processors.  And, most recently, foreseeing
    the rise of software-defined networking, he has worked with people
    from both the networking and PL communities to develop new,
    high-level languages (Frenetic, Pyretic) for programming networks.
    In summary, Prof. Walker is a groundbreaking researcher in
    programming languages, connecting foundations to novel
    applications.

2014:
- Awardee: Sumit Gulwani
  Citation: |
    Sumit Gulwani has made pioneering contributions to the field of
    programming languages, especially in the areas of program analysis
    and program synthesis.  Building on his foundational work in
    program analysis including using randomized algorithms, improving
    abstract interpretation, and reasoning about programs as
    continuous functions, Dr. Gulwani recognized the important
    connection between program verification and program synthesis.
    His research has demonstrated that imprecise human intent, in the
    form of examples, natural language, and other kinds of input, can
    be transformed into incomplete program specifications, which
    together with ranking techniques can then be used to synthesize
    intended programs, empowering users to accomplish complex and
    repetitive programming tasks without needing any knowledge of
    programming. His contributions include algorithms for synthesizing
    string transformation programs by examples, published in POPL
    2011, and the technical basis for "Flash Fill", a new feature
    shipping in Microsoft's Excel 2013.  He has since then extended
    this line of algorithmic work to synthesizing programs in several
    other important domains and also broadly advertised this line of
    work by publishing in top-tier ACM conferences in various other
    areas including AI, machine learning, HCI, databases, and
    knowledge discovery. He has also championed the application of
    program synthesis techniques to developing intelligent tutoring
    systems for numerous subject domains including introductory
    programming, mathematics, logic, and automata theory.  The
    visionary aspects of his work were recently recognized by the CACM
    Editorial Board when two of his recent papers appeared as CACM
    Research Highlights in the same issue, and a summary of his work
    on computer-aided Education was accepted to appear as a CACM
    article.

    In summary, Dr. Gulwani is a highly motivated, creative, and
    inter-disciplinary researcher whose vision is to empower computer
    users around the world to be more productive and educated.  His
    insights in using program synthesis to address problems in
    end-user programming and education will have deep and lasting
    influence.

- Awardee: Lars Birkedal
  Citation: |
    Lars Birkedal is a world leader in foundational programming
    languages research, and *the* pre-eminent researcher of his
    generation in the area of programming language semantics.  His
    work, spanning a multitude of top journal and conference
    publications, has had significant impact in many areas.  These
    include foundational type theory, compiler implementation,
    Milner's bigraphical reactive systems, logics and models for
    relational parametricity, and verification technology for
    semantically complex languages.

    Birkedal is a pioneer in "bringing semantics into the 21st
    century": developing rigorous and scalable semantic and
    verification techniques to account for the needs and complexities
    of modern languages.  Toward this end in particular, he has (a)
    made numerous advances to the theory and practice of region-based
    memory management, (b) made fundamental contributions to the
    theory of relational parametricity, which underlies our semantic
    understanding of abstract data types, and (c) developed
    higher-order separation logics and other powerful tools for the
    modular verification of realistic imperative, object-oriented, and
    concurrent programming patterns.

    In short, Birkedal has tackled hard problems of paramount
    importance to the future of programming language research, and has
    made startling advancements across the board.  He has done so both
    independently, via the research group he built up at the IT
    University of Copenhagen, and also through fruitful collaborations
    with an impressive network of international colleagues, thus
    setting an excellent example for other junior researchers.
