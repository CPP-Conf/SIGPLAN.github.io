  Awardee: "Hari K. Pyla, Virginia Tech"
  Citation: |
    Hari Pyla's work is motivated by the need to leverage concurrency
    to achieve performance, and the challenge of avoiding deadlocks in
    concurrent shared memory programs. He has introduced Sammati, a
    new approach that transparently and deterministically detects and
    recovers from deadlocks, without requiring modification to source
    code. This approach not only avoids errors, but also allows more
    effective composition of lock-based code. Hari's system also
    supports coarse-grained speculative parallelism, supporting
    difficult-to-parallelize applications and achieving significant
    speedups in practice.

    M&#225;rcio Ribeiro's research addresses the problem of
    maintaining software defined using "virtual separation of
    concerns." The virtual separation of concerns technique presents
    software with features defined using code between \#ifdef and
    \#endif (as in the C preprocessor) to the programmer in a way that
    hides various features that are not of immediate
    interest. However, when maintaining such software, it is easy to
    break code in hidden features. The solution approach uses a
    specialized dataflow analysis that takes features and allowed
    feature combinations into account. The results of this analysis
    are used to warn the programmer if there are dependencies between
    the changed code and any hidden features. These ideas are being
    implemented in a tool that will allow independent development of
    parallel features.

  Awardee: "Tudor Dumitras, Carnegie Mellon University"
  Citation: |
    Tudor Dumitras's research identifies and addresses the leading
    causes of both unplanned failures and planned downtime resulting
    from software upgrades in distributed systems. Traditional
    fault-tolerance approaches concentrate almost entirely on
    responding to, avoiding, or tolerating unexpected faults or
    security violations. However, scheduled events such as software
    upgrades account for most system unavailability and often
    introduce data loss or latent errors. Tudor defines three abstract
    properties required for improving the dependability of software
    upgrades.  Building on empirically derived insights on current
    upgrade practices and problems, Tudor's work harnesses the
    opportunities provided by emerging technologies such as cloud
    computing to simplify large-scale upgrades, to allow upgrades to
    be executed efficiently online, and to improve their
    dependability.


2008:
  Awardee: "Ciera Jaspan, Carnegie Mellon University"
  Citation: |
    Ciera Jaspan's research targets the programming difficulties
    associated with using software frameworks. Plug-in writers need to
    satisfy a variety of framework constraints, and Ciera is directly
    motivated by the kinds of plug-in errors that frequently arise in
    today's frameworks. She has defined a new abstraction for
    expressing framework constraints as well as lightweight
    annotations and an associated static analysis to enforce this
    abstraction.  Ciera is focused on making the right tradeoffs to
    ensure her solution is useful in practice.
