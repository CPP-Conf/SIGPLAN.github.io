   (for 2000) [Adaptive Optimization in the Jalape&#241;o JVM](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/353171.353175)
  Citation: |
    The 2000 OOPSLA paper "Adaptive Optimization in the Jalape&#241;o JVM"
    describes the architecture of adaptive optimization in what is now
    known as the Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine), continuing a
    line of research in dynamic adaptive optimizing compilers including
    Self and Animorphic (later HotSpot). The novelty of this paper was
    its use of continuous sampling to obtain execution statistics for
    optimized as well as unoptimized code. Also, because Jikes RVM is
    written entirely in Java, the techniques apply not only to the
    application but also to the VM and its components. Follow-on work
    has used, refined, and extended upon this adaptive optimization
    infrastructure. The paper has inspired significant further
    innovation in dynamic profiling and remains a primary reference for
    its exposition of the basic ingredients of adaptive optimization
    for modern VM-based languages.

  Citation: |
    The 1999 OOPSLA paper "Implementing Jalape&#241;o in Java" describes how
    the authors implemented a Java Virtual Machine in the Java
    language. This system, which was eventually renamed the Jikes RVM
    and released to the public, enabled a whole range of academic and
    industrial research in virtual machines that would have been
    difficult or impossible otherwise. To this day, researchers
    successfully use the Jikes RVM as a platform for new
    investigations.

    (for 1998) [Ownership Types for Flexible Alias Protection](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/286936.286947)
  Citation: |
    In their 1998 OOPSLA paper, "Ownership Types for Flexible
    Protection," David Clark, John Potter, and James Nobel introduced
    the notion of "ownership types" to control inter-object aliasing
    statically, making it easier to reason about the dynamic topology
    of an object-oriented program. This work is part of the broader
    trend of trying to handle issues of isolation and modularity while
    retaining expressiveness.

    (for 1997) [Call Graph Construction in Object-Oriented Languages](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/263698.264352)
  Citation:
    In their 1997 OOPSLA paper "Call Graph Construction in
    Object-Oriented Languages," David Grove, Greg DeFouw, Jeffrey Dean,
    and Craig Chambers studied the existing algorithms for call-graph
    construction in object-oriented languages and brought them together
    into a unified framework. This framework is both theoretical,
    allowing the authors to compare the precision of the different
    algorithms, and also practical in that they built a single
    parameterized implementation of all of the algorithms. This
    implementation allowed them to conduct a thorough empirical
    evaluation of the algorithms, which had not been previously
    possible because the algorithms had been implemented separately and
    applied to different programs. In the process, the authors
    discovered and evaluated a few new variations suggested by their
    framework. This kind of consolidation paper is important for moving
    the field forward since it provides theoretical models to build on
    and performance evaluations as benchmarks. It has served as a model
    for later work of this kind.
