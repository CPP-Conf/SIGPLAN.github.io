    SIGPLAN's parent organization, ACM, has issued a
    [statement](http://www.acm.org/about-acm/suspension-of-visas)
    expressing serious concern about
    [President Donald Trump's recent Executive Order
    (EO)](https://www.scribd.com/document/337740314/Trump-Executive-Order-1)
    that restricts entry to the USA for citizens of certain countries.
    The SIGPLAN Executive Committee, consisting of your elected
    representatives, shares these concerns. The EC is currently
    engaged in a vigorous dialogue about how to best respond.  We
    strongly believe that the practice of science and its quest for
    knowledge and the betterment of the human condition, should be
    independent of physical, political, cultural, and economic
    barriers.  While we hope that the EO is rescinded (and will work
    toward this outcome), we are developing contingency plans for
    organizing future SIGPLAN events so as to maximize inclusiveness
    of the worldwide scientific community. We welcome your input.
