title: "Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) "
---
The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of
dynamic languages, their implementation and application. While mature
dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, Prolog, and
APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new generation of
dynamic scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Tcl,
Lua, and Clojure are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS
provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and
share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and
development.

Awards

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006
    -   Recipient: Armin Rigo and Samuele Pedroni
    -   Title: PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine Construction
    -   Conference: DLS 2006
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753)
    -   Citation: The 2006 DLS paper "PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine
        Construction" introduced the PyPy Python interpreter and the
        RPython framework. Both are still highly relevant in various
        areas to this day and will continue to be influential for many
        years, thus demonstrating highly impressive long-term vision
        and impact. The paper laid the theoretical and practical
        foundations of constructing a virtual machine from a
        high-level description and was consequently built upon by
        numerous follow-up publications. The software, which continues
        to be developed by a large and active open source community,
        proved extensively usable in multiple academic and industrial
        contexts.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005
    -   Recipient: Pascal Costanza and Robert Hirschfeld
    -   Title: Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming--An Overview of ContextL
    -   Conference: DLS 2005
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146842](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146842)
    -   Citation: The 2005 DLS paper "Language Constructs for
        Context-oriented Programming: An Overview of ContextL"
        introduced a framework that enables programmers to modify the
        behavior of a program based on the context in which it is
        used, without requiring changes to the original program. This
        paper triggered a cascade of research on Context-oriented
        Programming and spawned a community with its own international
        workshop series, which is still going strong today.
