title: "Onward!"
---
Symposium on New Ideas in Programming and Reflections on Software
(Onward!) is a forum for new ideas and paradigms for every
aspect of programming. Welcomed are papers that propose and argue for
new approaches to the creation of software as well as reflections on
technology and ideas bearing on programming broadly construed.

Awards
------

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006
    -   Recipient: Friedrich Steimann
    -   Title: The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming
    -   Conference: Onward! 2006
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1167514](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1167514)   
    -   Citation: The 2006 Onward! Essay "The Paradoxical Success of
        Aspect-Oriented Programming" presents a considered and
        articulated exploration of the nature of aspect-oriented
        programming (AOP). In particular, the paper takes a hard look
        at the value proposed for AOP, together with an examination of
        what is achieved and what sacrifices appear to be
        necessary. The paper does not attack AOP, but rather takes a
        sober look at the hopes and the fears. In doing so, the paper
        provides a careful review that might also form the basis for
        progress, even if the form of progress might differ from the
        original promise.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005
    -   Recipient: Jonathan Edwards
    -   Title: Subtext--Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming
    -   Conference: Onward! 2005
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094811.1094851](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094811.1094851)
    -   Citation: The 2005 Onward! paper "Subtext--Uncovering the
        Simplicity of Programming" presented a new kind of
        programming, unifying programs and their execution, and which
        helped establish Onward! as a forum for high-end, lateral
        thinking about programming.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2014 for 2004
    -   Recipient: Tim Sheard
    -   Title: Languages of the Future
    -   Conference: Onward! 2004
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1052883.1052897](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1052883.1052897)
    -   Citation: The 2004 Onward! paper "Languages of the Future"
        pioneered the idea of lightweight dependently-typed
        programming, and idea that has since found its way into
        several languages, and continues to progress today.  This
        paper is notable for bringing together complex ideas in a
        compelling way; pointing to how they could be incorporated
        into “ordinary” languages; and influencing the practical world
        of software development with this pearl of a design.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2013 for 2003
    -   Recipient: Martin Rinard
    -   Title: Acceptability-oriented Computing
    -   Conference: Onward! 2003
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=949344.949402](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=949344.949402)
    -   Citation: The 2003 Onward! paper "Acceptability-Oriented
        Computing" introduced the approach of defining the boundaries of
        acceptable program behavior for a software system, and then
        augmenting the original system by layering components to enforce
        those boundaries&#8212;this instead of attempting to construct a
        completely error-free system. This paper led to a still-expanding
        series of papers exploring this approach, its capabilities,
        and its benefits.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2012 for 2002
    -   Recipients: James Noble and Robert Biddle
    -   Title: Notes on Postmodern Programming
    -   Conference: Onward! 2002
    -   Paper:
        [http://dreamsongs.com/Files/Onward!Proceedings.pdf](http://dreamsongs.com/Files/Onward!Proceedings.pdf)
    -   Citation: The 2002 Onward! paper "Notes on Postmodern
        Programming" uses postmodern concepts to understand contemporary
        programming, especially as software grows in scale and design is
        dispersed to a diversity of stakeholders. This paper is notable
        because it triggered a storm of immediate responses and ongoing
        discussion on the Web; it introduced the essay genre to the
        programming community and cut the path that led to a new
        technical track at Onward! (Essays); and it stated for the first
        time the philosophical model of at-scale software development
        that dominates today.
