- ***The composition of the steering committee.***
   
> The steering committee will include the conference chairs from the 
> previous 5 LCTES workshops/conferences.

- ***The way the members are rotated on and off the steering committee.***

> A chair of the LCTES conference will automatically become a member of
> the committee the following year. A member of the LCTES steering
> committee will no longer be on the steering committee once 5 LCTES 
> conferences are held after this member was last chair.

- ***How the chair of the steering committee is determined.***

> The chair of the steering committee is determined by a majority vote
> of the steering committee members. The current steering committee 
> chair will initiate the election of a new steering committee chair.

- ***The schedule of the conference; that is how often and what time of year.***

> The LCTES conference will be held once a year. The current preference is 
> for the conference to be colocated with SIGPLAN's PLDI conference and to
> be held either preceding or following the conference. PLDI is usually 
> held in June.

- ***The way the rules can be changed in the future.***

> The rules of the steering committee can be changed given a majority 
> vote from the steering committee and approval from the SIGPLAN 
> Executive committee.  

- ***The selection of the conference and program chairs.***

> The LCTES conference and program chairs will be selected by the      
> steering committee and sent for approval to SIGPLAN Executive        
> Committee. There will be at least one conference and one program     
> chair. The steering committee may also decide to select conference 
> and/or program co-chairs. The steering committee should pick the 
> conference and program chairs approximately 2 years in advance of the
> the conference. When LCTES is jointly held with another conference, then 
> the chair for the other conference may serve as a substitute for the 
> conference or program chair of LCTES during that year. 

- ***The interaction of the conference and program chairs with the steering committee.*** 

> If the SIGPLAN rules require approval on some issue, the request     
> should first be forwarded to the LCTES steering committee. The       
> steering committee will give advice on a variety of issues. However, 
> the SIGPLAN Executive Committee will make the decision regarding   
> approval of such requests.  

- ***The selection of the program committee.***

> The program chair will propose a program committee to the LCTES     
> steering committee. After receiving advice from the LCTES steering  
> committee, the conference and program chairs will request approval of  
> the proposed program committee from SIGPLAN Executive Committee. A  
> physical program committee is strongly recommended.

- ***Eligibility to submit papers.***

> The conference and program chairs are not allowed to submit papers to 
> the LCTES conference in the year in which they are a chair. 

- ***Publishing the proceedings.***

> The conference and program chairs will coordinate with SIGPLAN   
> Executive Committee regarding publishing the proceedings.

Suggestions for the LCTES General Chair and Program Chair
--------------------------------------------------------- 


- ***Submission Process.***

> Papers should be submitted electronically, preferably through a  
> web-based form.
>                                                                     
>  [Currently, the START software (free) or the Cyberchair software
>  (add \$5000 to the TRMF) are available for this task. We have found 
>  that the START software was adequate for our needs.]

- ***Reviewing submissions.***

> Each paper should have at least 3 reviews. It would be desirable to 
> assign 4 reviewers in case someone does not turn in a review. 

- ***Program committee meetings.***

> LCTES has numerous participants from the North America, Europe, and 
> Asia. The past program committee members have also come from these   
> three continents as well as others (Australia and South America). It 
> is probably not feasible to have a program committee meeting where   
> most of the committee could attend. We recommend having an online 
> program committee meeting, where communication is accomplished via   
> e-mail.

- ***Advertisement***

> The call for LCTES papers and participation should be distributed at 
> the appropriate meetings and conferences. The LCTES chairs should    
> compile a list of meetings where the calls should be distributed. They 
> should solicit attending colleagues (in particular, PC members) to   
> distribute the call at such meetings. These calls should also be     
> posted as articles on appropriate newsgroups and should appear in    
> other appropriate mediums (SIGPLAN Notices, e-mail distributions,    
> etc). 

- ***Selection of program committee members.***

> The program committee itself should contain a balance of expertise   
> between the areas that are currently pertinent to the conference.    
> There are also ACM guidelines concerning membership of the program   
> committee that should be considered before selecting the committee   
> members.
