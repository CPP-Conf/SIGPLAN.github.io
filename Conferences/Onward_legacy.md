title: "Onward!—the Early Years"
---
Onward! was founded in 2002 as a “track” at OOPSLA. In 2003 and 2004 the proceedings were published 
in the OOPSLA Companion. In 2005 SIGPLAN agreed to publish Onward! papers and Essays in the OOPSLA 
proceedings. At that time Essays was not part of Onward!; Essays migrated into Onward! in 2009. 
Finally in 2011, SIGPLAN made Onward! an official SIGPLAN Symposium, and thereafter Onward! 
proceedings appeared as separate conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

Over time, Onward! has had films, short papers, presentations, and other one-off venues and 
events. Almost all of them are in the ACM Digital Library somewhere, but tracking down the 
ones from 2002 through 2010 can be daunting. This page is a Table of Contents for all the Onward! 
material from 2002 through 2010.
