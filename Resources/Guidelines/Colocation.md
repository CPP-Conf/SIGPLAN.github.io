<!-- BCP: This is not linked from any of the other guidelines documents,
     though it _is_ linked from the main SIGPLAN page via _data/Links.yaml.
     I question whether many people are going to find it that way, so if we
     want to keep it (I find it rather perplexing, personally, but perhaps
     it is useful to somebody) we should link it from at least the GenChair
     and ConfereceOrganizers documents.  My preference would be just to
     delete it. -->

In case a conference/workshop (CoLo) wants to co-locate with a SIGPLAN
conference (Main Event), there are guidelines to follow that depend
upon whether or not the CoLo is
[sponsored](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Proposals/Sponsored) by
SIGPLAN.

* Fully SIGPLAN Sponsored CoLos
  * Budget covered and TMRF submitted by Main Event.
  * Expenses such as PC Meeting, Speaker, Committee Dinners, Publications, Social Events, Complimentary registration must be approved by Main Event at TMRF submission time.
  * Registration handled by Main Event.
  * Sponsorship handled by Main Event
  * Venue negotiations handled by Main Event.

* Partially SIGPLAN Sponsored CoLos (with other SIGs or with IEEE)
  * Separate budget and TMRF.
  * Registration handled by Main Event.
  * Expenses such as PC Meeting, Speaker, Committee Dinners, Publications, Social Events, Complimentary registration must be approved by Main Event at TMRF submission time.
