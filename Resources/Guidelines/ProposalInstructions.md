title: "Instructions for Preparing a SIGPLAN PC Proposal"
---

The SIGPLAN PC proposal spreadsheet is intended both (1) to help PC
Chairs review coverage and diversity while developing a PC proposal
and (2) to help the SIGPLAN EC quickly evaluate and approve proposals.

- Start by downloading the [PC proposal
  spreadsheet](/Resources/Guidelines/sigplan-pc-proposal-template.xlsx)
  template and filling in the name of your meeting in the indicated
  cell.  Also, please rename the file to conferencename-year.xlsx for
  free-standing conferences and
  workshopname-year-mainconferencename.xlsx for workshops and other
  colocated events.)

- Review [SIGPLAN's diversity
  policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Diversity/)

- For PC members in industry jobs (except industrial research labs),
  please include a comment on their reviewing experience and
  publications.

- The "Year of PhD" columns is not intended to create a gigantic
  amount of work for you -- its purpose is to help the EC evaluate the
  age balance of the committee and to make sure that potential
  committee members who do not have PhDs at all can be flagged for
  discussion.  Feel free to give an approximate year if it's not easy
  to get an exact one.

- Similarly, the purpose of the "Last served on this PC" column is
  mainly to check for PC members who have served in the past three
  years -- if you don't know whether or when someone has served before
  that, feel free to enter ">3 years".

- Use the "Connection to organizers" column to note close connections
  between proposed PC members and the organizers of the
  conference (e.g., former advisor, student, or postdoc, same
  institution, etc.) -- especially with the PC chair(s).

- To expedite forming the PC, make sure you've chosen some alternate
  PC members, to be invited in case someone in the "first round"
  declines to serve.  Use the "Invite now or keep as alternate" column
  to indicate which is which.  You may also find it useful to make
  notes in the Comments column about who a given alternate might
  replace.

- The "Optional" columns to the right of the vertical gray bar are
  truly optional: the EC will appreciate this information (especially
  links to websites), but it is not required.
