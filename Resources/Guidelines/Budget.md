title: "Contingencies and Return-to-SIG lines in Conference Budgets"
---

ACM conference budgets are expected to include two kinds of costs that are
often misunderstood. We briefly explain their purpose below. In both cases
the amount budgeted is a percentage of other conference expenses. The exact
amount will vary somewhat from year-to-year and conference to conference,
depending on perceived risk. It also varies somewhat between different
SIGs. <i> For SIGPLAN conferences, it is important to check with the Vice
Chair for Conferences to determine the applicable rate.  <!-- BCP: No one
has ever asked me for this information, nor would I know what to say if they
did! --> <!-- AF: My guess? It is there to make sure that we can complain if
someone does something overly lavish by incurring an unusually high
registration rate. If so, we can reword to make it more precise for that purpose. -->
For conferences cosponsored with other SIGs, please also check with the
cosponsoring SIG.</i>


### Contingency

This is intended to cover unexpected costs 
incurred by the conference, to cover worse-than-expected 
attendance, or sometimes just to provide funding for some extra opportunity 
that arises during later planning stages. The SIGPLAN Executive Committee 
establishes a rate for &quot;low risk&quot; conferences, i.e. conferences that have 
been held regularly in the same country with predictable attendance. It is 
adjusted for higher risk situations such as new conferences, above-average 
attendance variations, for conferences that are held for the first time 
outside the U.S., or for conferences that need to be planned unusually far 
in advance.

Any amount left over from the 
contingency budget becomes part of the conference profit, which goes into 
SIGPLAN's fund balance. That in turn is used to pay for a variety of SIGPLAN 
projects to benefit SIGPLAN members and future conference attendees. 
Correspondingly, SIGPLAN must cover conference losses, if any.

### Return-to-SIG

This line item in the budget is somewhat misnamed. 

Each SIG, including SIGPLAN, is assessed a charge by ACM to 
cover expenses incurred by ACM on behalf of the SIG and its associated 
conferences. This is essentially a tax by ACM on SIG expenses. The rate 
decreases somewhat with higher SIG expenses. Hence the average rate varies 
across SIGs, and is adjusted annually. It is referred to as the "allocation" at 
the SIG / SIG Governing Board level. 
SIGPLAN calculates the return-to-SIG rate for each conference 
to cover the conference's share of this fee to ACM. The fee is necessary to 
avoid a loss to SIGPLAN; it is not extra income for SIGPLAN, and SIGPLAN is 
required to cover the cost whether or not there is sufficient money in the 
conference budget. 

ACM uses SIG assessments to cover a wide variety of expenses 
incurred on behalf of the SIGs, which are essentially impossible to account for 
individually or to charge directly to conferences. These include:

<ul>
	<li>
	Help from SIG services with various conference issues, e.g. 
	help with budgets, hotel negotiations, publicity/promotion, accounting, some 
	visa issues for attendees, etc. </li>
	<li>

	Help with publications, Digital Library, and printing issues. </li>
	<li>
	Protection against legal liability (both legal support and 
	insurance). Last resort protection against financial liability. </li>
	<li>
	Maintenance of ACMs conference calendar, and sometimes web 
	pages on their machines. </li>
	<li>
	Overhead associated with the administration of ACM itself 
	(which in turn deals with some policy issues, negotiations with publishers, 
	the &quot;free&quot; part of the ACM Portal, etc.) </li>

</ul>
Clearly there is only a very approximate correspondence between 
the expenses incurred by a conference and the services it requires from ACM. But 
large conferences with many co-located events do require more services and incur 
larger risks than smaller ones. Precise accounting would be impractical and 
would discourage early use of ACM resources, which is likely to cause more 
serious problems later. 
ACM's budget, including that for SIG-related services, is 
controlled by the ACM Council, which includes representation from the SIG 
Governing Board, which in turn consists of all SIG Chairs. 
SIGPLAN's finances have historically benefited from profitable 
conferences, typically because conferences have exceeded their attendance 
expectations, or possibly because they have failed to spend their entire 
contingency. Often this was made possible by generous corporate contributions 
for expenses that would otherwise not fit into a budget. This has enabled 
SIGPLAN to provide some off-budget services to conferences, fund several forms 
of student and educator support at conferences and occasional other special 
projects, and historically kept SIGPLAN membership fees down, especially for 
students. For SIGPLAN to remain financially viable it is important to continue 
this trend.
