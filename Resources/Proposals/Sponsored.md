title: "SIGPLAN Sponsorship Proposal"
---
Executive Summary
-----------------

Events sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN benefit from SIGPLAN's name and
oversight, and are underwritten financially by SIGPLAN. SIGPLAN takes
a close interest in its sponsored events, and helps with their
planning and organization.

Rationale
---------

As part of its activities, ACM SIGPLAN has two types of relationship
with conferences and workshops: *sponsorship* and *in-cooperation*. The
primary difference between the two is that SIGPLAN takes financial
responsibility for the events it sponsors, and accordingly requires 
a close working relationship with the organizers of the event. This page
describes sponsored status; a separate page describes
[in-cooperation status](/Resources/Proposals/Cooperated).

Benefits
--------

Sponsored status provides a number of benefits:

- You can use the name "The ACM SIGPLAN Conference / Workshop on ..." for
  the event. <!--- BCP: What about "symposium? What about other permutations
  of these words? --->
- SIGPLAN takes financial responsibility for the event.
- You have access to the [PAC Fund](/PAC) to support participation in the event.
- Your proceedings (if any) will automatically be published in the Digital Library.
- ACM can provide help with site selection, including venue negotiations.
- You will receive help and guidance in organizing the event,
  including an instruction manual.  <!--- BCP: Where is this instruction
  manual? Why don't we just make it available to everybody and link it here? --->

These are in addition to the benefits available with in-cooperation status:

- Announcements about the meeting can be disseminated via
  SIGPLAN's mailing list. (Contact [infodir\_sigplan@acm.org](mailto:infodir_sigplan@acm.org?subject=SIGPLAN%20Mailing%20List).)
- You will get entries in the _Call for Papers_
  and _Professional Calendar_ sections of _Communications of the ACM_, free of charge.
- You can also buy an advertisement in _CACM_ at a special rate. Placement
  of such advertisements should be arranged through ACM Headquarters. Please
  check CACM as to the lead time required. Discounts on ACM mailing lists
  are also available.

Responsibilities
----------------

The requirements for SIGPLAN sponsored status
include the following:

- The event must have an open call for participation and a clearly
  documented evaluation and review process.
- The meeting must be budgeted according to the ACM sponsorship rules,
  which include filling out a standard budget form. The event is
  expected at least to break even financially.
- Registration costs should be reasonable; if there is a reduced
  registration rate, then SIGPLAN members should be eligible for it.
- For its various administrative services, such as providing help,
  information, publicity, mailing lists, and producing a proceedings,
  a percentage of conference income is budgeted for ACM services.
- Critical decisions, such as setting the budget and selecting the
  program chair and the program committee<!-- BCP: But not the general
  chair?? -->, have to be approved by
  the [SIGPLAN Executive Committee](/ContactUs).  (Concretely, proposals for
  these decisions should be emailed to the SIGPLAN vice chair,
  [vc\_sigplan@acm.org](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org), who will forward them to
  the EC.  For program committee proposals, please use the [PC proposal spreadsheet](/Resources/Guidelines/sigplan-pc-proposal-template.xlsx).)
- A final post-event report is required. <!-- BCP: This requirement seems to
  be universally ignored --> 

Sponsored events must follow 
SIGPLAN [policies and procedures](/Resources/Guidelines/ConferenceOrganizers).

Event organizers are encouraged to contact the ACM
Headquarters ([incoop@acm.org](mailto:incoop@acm.org)), to have
SIGPLAN membership materials sent directly to the conference
location for display there.   

Publication
-----------

-   A SIGPLAN-sponsored event might have an official
    proceedings, in physical or in electronic form, or both. If it
    does, the proceedings must be made available in digital form for
    inclusion in the ACM Digital Library, regardless of how else it is
    published.  
-   If the proceedings are published on paper, the preferred route
    is to produce the proceedings as an ACM publication. However,
    alternative publishers are occasionally acceptable, usually for
    historical reasons.  

How to Apply
------------

To receive SIGPLAN-sponsored status, you need SIGPLAN to endorse your proposal.
To apply, send a request to the
[SIGPLAN Vice Chair](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org),
preferably at least **eighteen months before** the event is to take
place. The request should include the following information, **in plain text** (not PDF or Word, please):

1.  Name, date, and location of meeting.
2.  Focus of the meeting.
3.  Intended audience and size.
4.  Organization of the meeting.
5.  Plans for soliciting conference participation, such as a call
    for papers/panels, etc.
6.  Submission review process, including size and expected
    composition of the program committee.
7.  Plans for publication.
8.  Names and affiliations of the organizers.
9.  Relevant information about any previous meeting,
    such as date, organizers, paper submission/acceptance counts,
    attendance, site, budget, and registration fees
    (if applicable).
10. List of any other financial resources, including other
    sponsorships and grants.
11. URL of the meeting information page.  

What Happens Next
-----------------

The request will be considered by the
[SIGPLAN Executive Committee](/ContactUs); a response is usually given
within two weeks. The Executive Committee 
can only endorse the request; final approval
comes from ACM, with the acceptance of the budget submitted with the
Technical Meeting Request Form.

The TMRF should be submitted to ACM at least 12 months in advance of
the event start date. Official ACM approval may take 4 to 6 weeks. It
is critical to await approval prior to spending funds and executing
contracts.
[Guidelines and forms](http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/manual_read_me)
are available from the ACM website; 
[contact them](mailto:paf_tmrf@acm.org) if you have any questions.

<!-- BCP: My reading of the above is that events that are _not_ part of a
     series (as described below) do not need to submit their PCs (or
     proposed PC chairs, or GCs) to the EC for approval -- it's not
     mentioned anywhere above.  I do not think this is what we intend!
     (There may be some other things that can be made a bit clearer here
     too...) -->

Event Series
------------

For SIGPLAN-sponsored events that occur on a
regular basis as part of a series (for example, every year),
SIGPLAN offers ongoing sponsorship. Such events must be
organized by a Steering Committee (SC). The SC, working
in partnership with the SIGPLAN Executive Committee (EC), is
responsible for the overall organization and financial plan of each
instance of the series. SIGPLAN has
[guidelines for steering committee organization](/Resources/Guidelines/SCommittee).  

To obtain ongoing sponsorship, the organizing group should send a
proposal to the [SIGPLAN Vice Chair](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org),
giving the information listed above for a sponsored event, for the
previous (up to) three instances and any planned future instances.
The request should also specify the proposed rules for the steering
committee composition and evolution, the method for selecting the
chair, and the responsibilities of the committee; these rules must
conform to [SIGPLAN guidelines for SCs](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Guidelines/SCommittee).

If an event is granted ongoing sponsored status, then, for each instance of
the event:

-   the Steering Committee must obtain approval for General Chair and
    Program Chair selections for each event from the SIGPLAN EC, prior to
    inviting the selected individuals;
-   approval must be sought from ACM via their TMRF for each event,
    as explained above;
-   the Program Chair of each event must obtain approval for Program Committee
    members (by submitting a completed
    [PC proposal 
    spreadsheet](/Resources/Guidelines/sigplan-pc-proposal-template.xlsx))
    from the SIGPLAN vice chair prior to inviting the selected individuals,
    and the 
    selection must conform to
    [SIGPLAN's Diversity Policy](/Resources/Policies/Diversity);
    <!-- BCP: Even here, we don't require that PC Chairs or GCs be vetted
         with the EC! -->
-   the General Chair of each event must provide the SIGPLAN Vice
    Chair with a post-event report; <!-- BCP: I have not seen even one of these! -->
-   the Steering Committee must contact the SIGPLAN Vice Chair when
    the composition or chair of the SC changes.
