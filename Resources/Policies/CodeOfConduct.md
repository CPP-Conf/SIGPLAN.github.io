title: "SIGPLAN Conference Code of Conduct Policy"
---

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and
expression are central to the aims and goals of SIGPLAN; these
require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every
person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual
respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, SIGPLAN
is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience, 
and abides by the
[ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment](http://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment)
(and associated
[FAQ](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/faqs-policy-discrimination-and-harassment)).

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned or
expelled from the conference without a refund, at the discretion of
the conference organizers.  If you are the target of inappropriate
behavior or remarks, please report it to a conference organizer; pick
someone with whom you feel comfortable speaking. Conference organizers
are requested to report incidents to the SIGPLAN Vice Chair.  If you
hear an inappropriate remark, intended or misjudged, this [list of
comebacks](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Good_sexism_comebacks)
may prove useful in the moment.  A useful resource is the [Geek
Feminism
Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/index.php?title=Conference_anti-harassment_policy),
which includes models for public announcements and guidance for
conference staff.
