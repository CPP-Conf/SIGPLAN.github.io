## Introduction

Climate change due to human emissions of greenhouse gases is an urgent
threat, one that requires massive efforts at every level of society. SIGPLAN
(and ACM and other scientific societies more broadly) contribute
disproportionately to this threat by hosting conferences that are
responsible for large amounts of carbon emissions, primarily as a result of
participants' air travel.

The SIGPLAN Climate Committee recognizes this dilemma and consequently seeks
to study and address SIGPLAN and ACM's role in climate change.

## About the SIGPLAN Climate Committee

In 2017, SIGPLAN formed an ad hoc committee to study the climate impact of
conferences and possible steps that SIGPLAN might take in response.

The SIGPLAN Climate Committee is chaired by SIGPLAN Vice-Chair [Benjamin
Pierce](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/); its other members are SIGPLAN
Chair [Jens Palsberg](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/), Past EC member
[Crista Lopes](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lopes/), and Past SIGPLAN Chair
[Michael Hicks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/).

Air travel is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, which in
turn are a significant contributor to climate change. SIGPLAN hosts a number
of annual scientific meetings at various locations throughout the world.
While such meetings are important for furthering important research, we need
to explore possible mitigations. Accordingly, the SIGPLAN Climate Committee
has taken several steps in examining and addressing this issue.


### What the Climate Committee has done so far

In 2017, the Climate Committee began raising issues of climate change and
air travel with the SIGPLAN community, conducting surveys and
discussions. The Committee also began its own research and studies into the
issue.

In 2018, the Climate Committee issued an [interim report](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/sigplan-climate-report.pdf) (current version June 2018), which summarizes a number of ideas under consideration and some experiments currently underway, following intensive discussions within the committee and
with the overall community at town hall meetings. The Climate Committee also issued a [white paper on carbon offset purchasing](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/carbon-offsets.pdf).

In the fall of 2018, the Committee asked the SIG Governing Board to make a
request to ACM to investigate legal barriers to ACM conferences’ directly
purchasing carbon offsets or offering the purchase of carbon offsets to
conference attendees at registration. The result was [ACM’s new carbon
offset
policy](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/conference-planning/conference-registration#h-carbon-offset-program). 
Work continues on implementing and improving the policy.

The Climate Committee also initiated the development of ACM's Carbon
Calculator for conferences. This tool allows a conference planner to upload
a spreadsheet of attendees’ origin cities to estimate the emissions due to
air travel for an entire conference.

In summer 2019, The Climate Committee authored a [SIGPLAN blog
post](https://blog.sigplan.org/2019/07/17/acm-conferences-and-the-cost-of-carbon/)
calling for (1) public accounting of carbon emissions by every ACM
conference, and (2) pricing of carbon in conference budgets.

### What the Climate Committee is doing

The Committee will be publishing an upcoming article on these topics in
Communications of the ACM (CACM) journal.

We are working with other SIGs on a data gathering and analytics project
around measuring carbon emissions from past conferences and calculating
emissions for future conferences. For instance, we may be able to predict
relative carbon emissions from different conference locations, or from
co-locating several conferences. [Some scripts written for these
purposes](https://github.com/YaZko/acm-climate) can be found on Github.

We continue to
- make sure that climate change is on the agenda at the SGB level
- investigate how ACM conferences might directly purchase carbon offsets
- make presentations at major SIGPLAN conferences

of things to work on!

## Carbon Offsets

One recent major effort has been evaluating the idea of carbon offsets as a
mechanism for reducing the conference's net carbon impact.  A
[report](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/sigplan-climate-report.pdf)
on what we have learned is available.

Carbon offsets have the potential to reduce SIGPLAN's net carbon impact
while furthering sustainability and developmental goals. They help
fund projects that would not otherwise be economically feasible given
start-up costs or the means of the communities they are
servicing. Ideally, they address the potential trade-off between
reducing carbon emissions and furthering the progress of
less-developed parts of the world.  They are not a long-term solution
to the problem of carbon emissions from scientific conferences, but
they are a useful stopgap, slowing the overall growth of atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations while other fossil fuel reduction
strategies are being developed.  An excellent discussion of the pros
and cons of carbon offsets in general and of specific project types
can be found in a [recent
report](https://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/Publications/Climate/SEI-WP-2016-03-ICAO-aviation-offsets-biofuels.pdf)
from the Stockholm Environmental Institute.

The carbon offset vendor that SIGPLAN currently works with is
[CoolEffect](https://www.cooleffect.org). For example, check out their
project that funds [building converters from cow manure to
biogas](https://www.cooleffect.org/content/project/community-biogas-program#What-it-does).

For those that like comparison shopping,
[Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/organisationsform) is another
excellent vendor.  It is a non-profit originally created as part of a
research project by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment. Its
carbon offset projects are
[registered](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/organisationsform) through the UN
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) standard and are either approved by or
awaiting approval under the Gold Standard — these are widely recognized
vetting groups.
