[Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL)](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmpl) 
is a Gold Open Access journal publishing research on all aspects of programming languages, 
from design to implementation 
and from mathematical formalisms to empirical studies. Each issue of the journal is devoted 
to a particular subject area within programming languages and will be announced through 
publicized Calls for Papers. All accepted papers receive two rounds of reviewing and authors 
can expect initial decisions regarding submissions in under 3 months. The journal operates 
in close collaboration with the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN) 
and is committed to making high-quality peer-reviewed scientific research in programming 
languages free of restrictions on both access and use.
