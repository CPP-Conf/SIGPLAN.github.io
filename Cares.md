### Purpose of SIGPLAN CARES 

SIGPLAN CARES is a subcommittee of SIGPLAN. All SIG events and communications 
abide by ACM’s policy against discrimination and harassment. If a violation 
of this policy occurs, ACM urges reporting the incident to the event chair or 
the ACM President, CEO, or COO. We recognize that reporting to a conference 
chair or an upper level ACM administrator can be intimidating, especially 
in the face of an already unpleasant experience. We have therefore established 
CARES: Committee to Aid REporting on discrimination and harassment policy 
violations.
 
The role of CARES is to serve as a resource consisting of well-known and 
respected people in the programming languages community who are approachable 
and willing to listen to and help people who experience discrimination and 
harassment at our events; the committee members can be a sounding board for 
these people and can provide advice on the steps necessary to have the matter 
further investigated by ACM. It is important to understand that for the matter 
to be reported, the person experiencing the incident must still themselves send 
the complaint to ACM where it will be handled according to ACM’s policy. The 
CARES committee cannot serve as an intermediary in that official process and it 
cannot be involved in any aspect of the handling of the complaint by ACM.
 
The motivation in providing a standing CARES committee is: (1) people are more 
likely to report harassment or discrimination incidents if familiar and respected 
members of the community are available for support, (2) unlike conference chairs, 
the members of the CARES committee will be chosen largely for their commitment and 
record on the targeted issues, (3) longer membership terms and an (eventually) 
established committee enable building experience and a record that inspires more 
trust for those considering coming forward about an incident, (4) committee members 
are expected to be physically present at our main events and work with event leaders 
to publicize their role, and (5) the presence of such a committee with respected 
and trusted members from the community assigned to watch for these issues should 
serve as a deterrent for behavior that violates the ACM code of conduct, as well as 
encourage us all to be aware of and speak up if we observe such behavior.


A [blog post](https://www.sigarch.org/what-happens-to-us-does-not-happen-to-most-of-you/) 
provides background about the formation of the first CARES committee 
in the architecture community and this blog post talks about harassment some members 
of our community have experienced.  The [SIGARCH/SIGMICRO CARES](https://www.sigarch.org/benefit/cares/) 
committee led to foundation of the SIGPLAN committee.

### SIGPLAN CARES Conferences Covered, Operations, and History

Initially, one or more CARES members will cover the following list of guaranteed sponsored conferences and 
their PC meetings, as invited.

- ICFP
- PLDI
- POPL
- SPLASH

CARES committee members may also cover other workshops and conferences sponsored or co-sponsored 
by SIGPLAN, when they normally would attend.  As the sponsoring organizations and/or committee 
expands in membership, it may add conferences to the guaranteed list.
