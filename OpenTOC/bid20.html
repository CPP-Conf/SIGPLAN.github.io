                  <p>The workshop in beautiful San Diego was composed of two submitted papers and two invited
                     talks.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The first paper presentation, "Power Modeling for Phytium FT-2000+ Multi-core Architecture"
                     by Zhixin Ou a PhD student from the National University of Defense Technology was
                     streamed from Hunan, China due to travel difficulties. Her talk describes the application
                     of HPCC benchmarks on the first software-based power model for the new Phytium FT-2000+/64
                     ARM platform. The results of these benchmarks of the software were compared with real
                     power measurements to prove how accurate this approach is.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The first invited talk by Ammar Awan a PhD student at Ohio State University, "Benchmarking
                     Deep Learning Workloads on Large-Scale HPC Systems" described machine learning and
                     deep learning benchmarks. He described parallel communication in distributed deep
                     learning for training image recognition networks and how it is different from typical
                     high performance computing parallel communication. He identified reproducibility and
                     benchmarks for new applications of deep learning as important future areas.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The second invited presentation was given by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)
                     user support lead Mahidhar Tatineni and addressed the "Evolution of Benchmarking on
                     SDSC systems". It was an interesting talk that gave an overview of platforms and benchmarks
                     at the supercomputing center closest to the conference venue. The speaker succeeded
                     in capturing all aspects in this regard during his 15-years of devoted work at the
                     San Diego Supercomputing Center.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The final paper presentation, "The ESIF-HPC-2 Benchmark Suite" was given by Christopher
                     Chang who works at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the HPC Application
                     group in Denver. He described the benchmark suite he and his team developed for procurement
                     of the most recent NREL supercomputer. He demonstrated a set of <em>dimensions</em> that are useful in classifying benchmarks and in systematically assessing their coverage
                     of performance measures. This suite is released as open source software on GitHub.

                  <p>Power and energy consumption is the first-class constraint on high-performance-computing
                     (HPC) systems. Understanding the power consumption on such systems is crucial for
                     software optimization and hardware architecture design. Unfortunately, the subtle
                     interactions between the CPU and the memory subsystem make precise power modeling
                     highly challenging on emerging multi-core architectures. This paper presents the first
                     software-based power model for Phytium FT-2000+/64, an ARM-based HPC multi-core architecture.
                     It shows by carefully choosing and modeling a set of system-wide metrics, one can
                     build an accurate power model for the multi-core CPU and the DRAM memory subsystem,
                     two major energy consumers of an HPC system computing node. We evaluate our approach
                     by applying it to HPCC benchmarks and comparing our results against real power measurement.
                     Experimental results show that our approach is highly accurately in modeling power
                     consumption of FT-2000+/64. The average error rate for CPU power modeling in all the
                     scales (8, 16, 32, 64 processes) is 2%, and the average error rate for memory power
                     modeling is about 7.5%.
