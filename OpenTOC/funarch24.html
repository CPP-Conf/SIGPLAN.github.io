				<p>In machine learning (ML), feature engineering is a crucial step that converts raw data to model inputs. This process traditionally relies on data processing languages (typically SQL), but now faces new challenges due to advancements in ML. We present the design of F3, a domain-specific language (DSL) and compiler developed at Meta. F3 leverages approaches developed in functional programming and type theory to support the ML engineers of a platform that serves billions of users</p>

				<p>This paper describes the design of a verified tool for analyzing tool paths defined in the RS-274 language for 3D printing systems. We describe how the analyzer was designed to allow a mixture of verification and code-extraction techniques to be combined for constructing a correct toolpath analyzer written in the OCaml language. We show how we moved from a fully hand-written OCaml program to one incorporating verified components, highlighting architectural decisions that were made to facilitate this process. Finally, we share a set of architectural lessons that are generally applicable to other software with a similar goal of integration of verified components.</p>

				<p>Surveys and experiments in economics involve stateful interactions: participants receive different messages based on earlier answers, choices, and performance, or trade across many rounds with other participants. In the design of Congame, a platform for running such economic studies, we decided to use delimited continuations to manage the common flow of participants through a study. Here we report on the positives of this approach, as well as some challenges of using continuations, such as persisting data across requests, working with dynamic variables, avoiding memory leaks, and the difficulty of debugging continuations.</p>
