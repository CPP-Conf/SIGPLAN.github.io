                  <p>As a language that is intended for building languages in a composable way, Racket
                     provides an especially rich set of constructs for control, including delimited continuations
                     and efficient reflection on continuations. This talk will explain Racket’s constructs
                     for control and describe how the implementation is built in layers.

                  <p>n the early days of the Eclipse OMR project, we created the unimaginatively named
                     JitBuilder API aiming to make it easier to build a JIT compiler. JitBuilder has been
                     used to create prototype JIT compilers in a few thousand lines of C++ for WebAssembly,
                     Lua, Smalltalk, Javascript, the Rosie Pattern Language, BF, Kaleidoscope, and Base9,
                     as well as a number of other less language-centric dynamic code generators (including
                     an alternative code generator for LLVM IR). Although it brings key facilities for
                     privatizing virtual machine state and translating bytecode handlers, the JitBuilder
                     API did not completely meet the “easy” goal particularly in the areas of extensibility
                     and debuggability and did not offer strong DSL optimization possibilities. In this
                     talk, I’ll explain and summarize the key features of the JitBuilder API before introducing
                     some recent exploratory work to create the next version: JitBuilder2. This new fully-fledged
                     (if currently in complete) compiler IL shares some directions with MLIR, but has some
                     unique challenges and features, all designed around the pursuit of “easy” JIT compiler
                     construction. Through the talk, I’ll show off some of these features (that’s right,
                     I’ll demo a compiler IL!) and highlight some of the interesting directions I think
                     we could take it from here.

                  <p>The Graal compiler uses a graphical sea-of-nodes IR that can be difficult to understand
                     and work with when trying to improve performance of complicated programs. When used
                     with an automatic partial evaluator, such as Truffle, and with a high-level language
                     with complex semantics such as Ruby, the resulting IR graphs become even harder to
                     work with. At Shopify, we’re working on new tools to understand complex Graal IR graphs
                     generated from the TruffleRuby and Sulong interpreters, as used to run a large, complex,
                     production application. We’ll show what these tools enable us to do and what innovative
                     ideas we can bring to understand the relevant parts of the graph without getting swamped
                     in the expanse of it.

                  <p>Dart might be the only contemporary programming language that changed its core principles
                     so radically between two major versions. 10 years ago, in 2010, it was born as a dynamically
                     typed programming language with optional static types - ideas of Strongtalk wrapped
                     into familiar C-like syntax. A language destined to be executed in a native VM with
                     an adaptive JIT compiler. Yet over the years Dart has evolved into a language with
                     a sound static type system, and is being deployed in contexts that require ahead-of-time
                     compilation and prohibit JITing. Now, it is even trying to get rid of the “billion-dollar
                     mistake” - null - and incrementally transition to non-nullable by default reference
                     types. This talk focuses on the architecture of Dart Virtual Machine and how it followed
                     the evolution of the Dart language, adapting to the new semantics and new execution
                     environments, where users wanted to bring Dart to.

                  <p>In this paper, we present an approach for programming microcontrollers that provides
                     more expressivity and safety than a low-level language approach traditionally used
                     to program such devices. To this end, we provide various abstraction layers (abstraction
                     of the microcontroller, of the electronic components of the circuit, and of concurrency)
                     which, while being adapted to the scarce resources of the hardware, offer high-level
                     programming traits for the development of embedded applications. The various presented
                     abstractions make use of an OCaml virtual machine able to run on devices with limited
                     resources and take advantage of the expressivity and extensibility of the language.
                     We illustrate the interest of our work on both entertainment applications and embedded
                     software examples.
