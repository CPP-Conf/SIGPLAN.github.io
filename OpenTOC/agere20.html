                  <p>The steady growth of data volume produced as continuous streams makes paramount the
                     development of software capable of providing timely results to the users. The Actor
                     Model (AM) offers a high-level of abstraction suited for developing scalable message-passing
                     applications. It allows the application developer to focus on the application logic
                     moving the burden of implementing fast and reliable inter-Actors message-exchange
                     to the implementation framework. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> In this paper, we focus on evaluating the model in high data rate streaming applications
                     targeting scale-up servers. Our approach leverages Parallel Patterns (PP) abstractions
                     to model streaming computations and introduces optimizations that otherwise could
                     be challenging to implement without violating the Actor Model's semantics. The experimental
                     analysis demonstrates that the new implementation skeletons we propose for our PPs
                     can bring significant performance boosts (more than 2X) in high data rate streaming
                     applications implemented in CAF.

                  <p>The paper introduces an Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework based on the Belief-Desire-Intention
                     (BDI) model of agency. The novelty of this framework is in relying on the Actor model,
                     instantiating each intentional agent as an autonomous micro-system run by actors.
                     The working hypothesis behind this choice is that defining the agents via actors results
                     in a more fine-grained modular architecture and that the execution of agent-oriented
                     programs is enhanced (in scalability as well as in performance) by relying on robust
                     implementations of Actor models such as Akka. The framework is benchmarked and analyzed
                     quantitatively and qualitatively against three other AOP frameworks: Jason, ASTRA
                     and Sarl.

                  <p>Applications increasingly demand distribution across the global Internet. The Actor
                     model of computation has been wisely designed to abstract communication between actors
                     and hence remains transparent w.r.t. distribution. Performance, security, and deployment
                     considerations, however, make it difficult to define a specific communication transport
                     that should be hardcoded into an actor framework. It is rather desirable to design
                     appropriate transport abstractions, which allow for flexible choices and configurations
                     of transport functions on the Internet. In this paper, we report about our ongoing
                     work of redesigning, implementing, and evaluating a network stack that abstracts transport
                     for the C++ Actor Framework (CAF). The stack allows for the exchanging of transport
                     protocols and adds configuration options as well as compositions of protocols. First
                     comparisons of TCP versus UDP with configurable reliability options are provided,
                     as well as an early evaluation of its performance.
