                  <p>A new metric was introduced to calculate the distance between actively modified files
                     in a source code repository and the files, which are rarely modified and may be considered
                     abandoned or even dead. It was empirically demonstrated that larger repositories have
                     larger values of the introduced metric. The metric may be used for earlier detection
                     of code maintenance anomalies and helping software developers make the decision of

                  <p>Natural language is the dominant form of writing software requirements. Its essential
                     ambiguity causes inconsistency of requirements, which leads to scope creep. On the
                     other hand, formal requirements specification notations such as Z, Petri Nets, SysML,
                     and others are difficult to understand by non-technical project stakeholders. They
                     often become a barrier between developers and requirements providers. The article
                     presents a controlled natural language that looks like English but is a strongly typed
                     object-oriented language compiled to UML/XMI. Thus, it is easily understood, at the
                     same time, by non-technical people, programmers, and computers. Moreover, it is formally
                     verifiable and testable. It was designed, developed, and tested in three commercial
                     software projects in order to validate the assumption that object-oriented design
                     can be applied to requirements engineering at the level of specifications writing.
                     The article outlines key features of the language and summarizes the experience obtained
                     during its practical application.</p>

                  <p>Coding assistance with deep learning is an emerging concern that has recently attracted
                     much attention in the software development community. To integrate coding assistance
                     with deep learning compactly, we focus on neural machine translation (NMT), which
                     allows users to translate natural language descriptions into expressions in a programming
                     language such as Python. A rising problem here is the limited availability of parallel
                     corpora, which is essential to train better NMT models. </p> 
                  <p> To overcome the problem, we propose a transcompiler-based back-translation, a data
                     augmentation method that generates parallel corpora from numerous source code repositories.
                     In this paper, we present our initial experimental results by comparing several NMT
                     models that are built upon the existing corpora and our corpora. The resulting BLEU
                     indicates that our proposed model is accurate enough to allow coding assistance in
                     the future.</p>

                  <p>This paper provides a highly opinionated and biased vision and a two-stage plan with
                     guidelines to reach a new era of software development, where anyone can create software
                     without bothering to write code. Moreover, this paper explores in depth the first
                     of these stages, which consists of creating a no-code tool based on six principles:
                     configuration driven development, APIs, open-source, cross-platform, cloud computing,
                     and design systems. An examination of each principle is presented and a case is made
                     for why such a combination of principles would lay the foundation for future development
                     efforts. Possible enquiries are addressed and a path is laid out for future works.</p>
