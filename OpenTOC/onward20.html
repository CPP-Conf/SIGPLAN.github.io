                  <p>Our community has explored various approaches to improve the programming experience.
                     Although many of them, such as Example-Based Live Programming (ELP), have shown to
                     be effective, they are still not widespread in conventional programming environments.
                     A reason for that is the effort required to provide sophisticated tools that rely
                     on run-time information. To target multiple language ecosystems, it is often necessary
                     to implement the same concepts, but for different languages and runtimes. Two emerging
                     technologies present an opportunity to reduce this effort significantly: the Language
                     Server Protocol (LSP) and language implementation frameworks such as GraalVM's Truffle.
                     In this paper, we show how an ELP system can be built in a language-agnostic way by
                     leveraging these two technologies. Based on our approach, we implemented the Babylonian
                     Programming system, an ELP system that has previously only been implemented for exploratory
                     ecosystems. Our system, on the other hand, brings ELP for all languages supported
                     by the GraalVM to Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Moreover, we outline what a language-agnostic
                     infrastructure needs to provide and how the LSP could be extended to support ELP also
                     independently from programming environments. Further, we demonstrate how our approach
                     enables the use of ELP in the context of polyglot programming. We illustrate the consequences
                     of our approach by discussing its advantages and limitations and by comparing the
                     features of our system to other ELP systems. Moreover, we give an outlook of how tools
                     that rely on run-time information could be built in the future. This in turn might
                     motivate future tool builders and researchers to consider implementing more tools
                     in a language-agnostic way from the start to make them available to a broader audience.

                  <p>Customizing software should be as easy as using it. Unfortunately, most customization
                     methods require users to abruptly shift from using a graphical interface to writing
                     scripts in a programming language. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> We introduce data-driven customization, a new way for end users to extend software
                     by direct manipulation without doing traditional programming. We augment existing
                     user interfaces with a table view showing the structured data inside the application.
                     When users edit the table, their changes are reflected in the original UI. This simple
                     model accommodates a spreadsheet formula language and custom data-editing widgets,
                     providing enough power to implement a variety of useful extensions. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> We illustrate the approach with Wildcard, a browser extension that implements data-driven
                     customization on the web using web scraping. Through concrete examples, we show that
                     this paradigm can support useful extensions to many real websites, and we share reflections
                     from our experiences using the tool. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> Finally, we share our broader vision for data-driven customization: a future where
                     end users have more access to the data inside their applications, and can more flexibly
                     repurpose that data as part of everyday software usage.

                  <p>As the impact of vulnerabilities increases in practice, it is imperative for programming
                     languages to include security as a first-class design consideration. While a number
                     of security-related language features have been proposed to address this need, in
                     many cases, we do not know enough about whether it is practical and useful to build
                     software systems in languages with these features. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> In this paper, we begin to investigate this question, using a case study methodology.
                     The setting of our case study is Wyvern, a recently designed language we selected
                     because it incorporates three advanced security-related features: capability safety
                     for enforcing the principle of least privilege, an effect system for tracking the
                     secure use of resources, and a language extension feature that mitigates command injection.
                     In our case study, we built a small standard I/O library, seeking to use the new language
                     features to create a library that is less vulnerable to misuse and can serve as a
                     building block for more secure programs, compared to conventional I/O library designs.
                     Our study suggests that these features are indeed practicable and useful, and thus
                     potentially promising for inclusion in other future language designs. It also sheds
                     light on the value and cost of these features and suggests directions for future research
                     on security-focused language design.

                  <p>Programmers are told "depend on interfaces, not implementations." But, given a program,
                     is it possible even to assess objectively whether such advice has been followed? 
                  </p> 
                  <p> Programmers frequently talk in ways like this about dependence, but the very term,
                     like many used in software engineering, has hitherto eluded precise definition. In
                     this work, we resolve a variety of confusions about dependence, and present a formal
                     definition unifying multiple varieties of software dependence, grounded in Halpern
                     and Pearl's theory of actual causation. This definition is parameterized by the formal
                     system characterizing the property of interest, and by constraints on "reasonable
                     changes" to the program. By picking different choices of formal system, one can specialize
                     our definition to characterize several notions of dependence, including build, correctness,
                     and performance dependences. Overall, our work provides a path to making conversations
                     about software dependence fully objective, and might serve as a basis for future work
                     that automatically checks forms of dependence that were previously too abstract or
                     high-level to be candidates for tools.

                  <p>Major simultaneous disruptions are currently under way in both hardware and software.
                     In hardware, ``extreme heterogeneity'' has become critical to sustaining cost and
                     performance improvements after Moore's Law, but poses productivity and portability
                     challenges for developers. In software, the rise of large-scale data science is driven
                     by developers who come from diverse backgrounds and, moreover, who demand the rapid
                     prototyping and interactive-notebook capabilities of high-productivity languages like
                     Python. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> We introduce the Intrepydd programming system, which enables data scientists to write
                     application kernels with high performance, productivity, and portability on current
                     and future hardware. Intrepydd is based on Python, though the approach can be applied
                     to other base languages as well. To deliver high performance, the Intrepydd toolchain
                     uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and high-level compiler optimizations of Intrepydd
                     kernels. Intrepydd achieves portability by its ability to compile kernels for execution
                     on different hardware platforms, and for invocation from Python or C++ main programs.
                     
                  </p> 
                  <p> An empirical evaluation shows significant performance improvements relative to Python,
                     and the suitability of Intrepydd for mapping on to post-Moore accelerators and architectures
                     with relative ease. We believe that Intrepydd represents a new direction of ``Discipline-Aware
                     Languages'' (DiALs), which brings us closer to the holy grail of obtaining productivity
                     and portability with higher performance than current Python-like languages, and with
                     more generality than current domain-specific languages and libraries.

                  <p>Read-eval-print-loops (REPLs) allow programmers to test out snippets of code, explore
                     APIs, or even incrementally construct code, and get immediate feedback on their actions.
                     However, even though many languages provide a REPL, the relation between the language
                     as is and what is accepted at the REPL prompt is not always well-defined. Furthermore,
                     implementing a REPL for new languages, such as DSLs, may incur significant language

                     interfaces (including computational notebooks). The obtained REPLs can then be generically
                     turned into an exploring interpreter, to allow exploration of the user's interaction.

                  <p> The approach is illustrated using three case studies, based on MiniJava, QL (a DSL
                     for questionnaires), and eFLINT (a DSL for normative rules). We expect sequential
                     languages, and the consequent design principles, to be stepping stones towards a better
                     understanding of the essence of REPLs.

                  <p>An analogy is an identification of structural similarities and correspondences between
                     two objects. Computational models of analogy making have been studied extensively
                     in the field of cognitive science to better understand high-level human cognition.
                     For instance, Melanie Mitchell and Douglas Hofstadter sought to better understand
                     high-level perception by developing the Copycat algorithm for completing analogies
                     between letter sequences. In this paper, we argue that analogy making should be seen
                     as a core primitive in software engineering. We motivate this argument by showing
                     how complex software engineering problems such as program understanding and source-code
                     transformation learning can be reduced to an instance of the analogy-making problem.
                     We demonstrate this idea using Sifter, a new analogy-making algorithm suitable for
                     software engineering applications that adapts and extends ideas from Copycat. In particular,
                     Sifter reduces analogy-making to searching for a sequence of update rule applications.
                     Sifter uses a novel representation for mathematical structures capable of effectively
                     representing the wide variety of information embedded in software.

                  <p>Despite being a very old discipline, pointer analysis still attracts several research
                     papers every year in premier programming language venues. While a major goal of contemporary
                     pointer analysis research is to improve its efficiency without sacrificing precision,
                     we also see works that introduce novel ways of solving the problem itself. What does
                     this mean? Research in this area is not going to die soon. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> I too have been writing pointer analyses of various kinds, specially for object-oriented
                     languages such as Java. While some standard ways of writing such analyses are clear,
                     I have realized that there are an umpteen number of nooks and pitfalls that make the
                     task difficult and error prone. In particular, there are several misconceptions and
                     undocumented practices, being aware of which would save significant research time.
                     On the other hand, there are lessons from my own research that might go a long way
                     in writing correct, precise and efficient pointer analyses, faster. This paper summarizes
                     some such learnings, with a hope to help readers beat the state-of-the-art in (Java)
                     pointer analysis, as they move into their research careers beyond 2020.

                  <p>Lines-of-code metrics (loc) are commonly reported in Programming Languages (PL), Software
                     Engineering (SE), and Systems papers. This convention has several different, often
                     contradictory, goals, including demonstrating the `hardness' of a problem, and demonstrating
                     the `easiness' of a problem. In many cases, the reporting of loc metrics is done not
                     with a clearly communicated intention, but instead in an automatic, checkbox-ticking,
                     manner. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> In this paper we investigate the uses of code metrics in PL, SE, and System papers.
                     We consider the different goals that reporting metrics aims to achieve, several various
                     domains wherein metrics are relevant, and various alternative metrics and their pros
                     and cons for the different goals and domains. We argue that communicating claims about
                     research software is usually best achieved not by reporting quantitative metrics,
                     but by reporting the qualitative experience of researchers, and propose guidelines
                     for the cases when quantitative metrics are appropriate.

                  <p> We end with a case study of the one area in which lines of code are not the default
                     measurement---code produced by papers' solutions---and identify how measurements offered
                     are used to support an explicit claim about the algorithm. Inspired by this positive
                     example, we call for other cogent measures to be developed to support other claims
                     authors wish to make.

                  <p>The long-standing aspiration for software reuse has made astonishing strides in the
                     past few years. Many modern software development ecosystems now come with rich sets
                     of publicly-available components contributed by the community. Downstream developers
                     can leverage these upstream components, boosting their productivity. 
                  </p> 
                  <p> However, components evolve at their own pace. This imposes obligations on and yields
                     benefits for downstream developers, especially since changes can be breaking, requiring
                     additional downstream work to adapt to. Upgrading too late leaves downstream vulnerable
                     to security issues and missing out on useful improvements; upgrading too early results
                     in excess work. Semantic versioning has been proposed as an elegant mechanism to communicate
                     levels of compatibility, enabling downstream developers to automate dependency upgrades.
                     
                  </p> 
                  <p> While it is questionable whether a version number can adequately characterize version
                     compatibility in general, we argue that developers would greatly benefit from tools
                     such as semantic version calculators to help them upgrade safely. The time is now
                     for the research community to develop such tools: large component ecosystems exist
                     and are accessible, component interactions have become observable through automated
                     builds, and recent advances in program analysis make the development of relevant tools
                     feasible. In particular, contracts (both traditional and lightweight) are a promising
                     input to semantic versioning calculators, which can suggest whether an upgrade is
                     likely to be safe.

                  <p>Programming languages researchers make a variety of different kinds of claims about
                     the design of languages and related tools and calculi. Each type of claim requires
                     different kinds of reasons and evidence to justify. Claims regarding the aesthetics
                     or elegance of a design, or its effects on people, are especially tricky to justify
                     because they are less strictly defined and thus are subject to change depending on
                     the exact audience. In this essay, we take an interdisciplinary approach to this problem
                     by drawing on the fields of argument theory and rhetorical analysis to develop a framework
                     for justifying audience-dependent claims. In particular, we argue that researchers
                     should provide descriptions of specific features of their systems that connect to
                     effects on audience in order to justify these claims. To demonstrate this framework,
                     we show several examples of how this is already being practiced in some programming
                     languages research, and conclude by calling for authors to provide descriptive evidence
                     to bolster such claims and to frame and strengthen other evaluation methods such as
                     user studies.
