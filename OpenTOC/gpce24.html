				<p>Design by Contract represents an established, lightweight paradigm for engineering reliable and robust software systems by specifying verifiable expectations and obligations between software components. Due to its laborious nature, developers hardly adopt Design by Contract in practice.
 
 
 
A plethora of research on (semi-)-automated inference to reduce the manual burden has not improved the adoption of so-called code contracts in practice.
 
 
 
This paper examines the potential of Generative AI to automatically generate code contracts in terms of pre- and postconditions for any Java project without requiring any additional auxiliary artifact.
 
 
 
To fine-tune two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, we derive a dataset of more than 14k Java methods comprising contracts in form of Java Modeling Language (JML) annotations, and train the models on the task of generating contracts.
 
 
 
We examine the syntactic and semantic validity of the contracts generated for software projects not used in the fine-tuning and find that more than 95% of the generated contracts are syntactically correct and exhibit remarkably high completeness and semantic correctness.
 
 
 
To this end, our fully automated method sets the stage for future research and eventual broader adoption of Design by Contract in software development practice.</p>

				<p>Assessing code quality is crucial for effective software maintenance and evolution. Traditional tools like SonarQube offer valuable insights at the application level but lack the granularity needed for detailed, feature-specific analysis. This paper emphasizes the importance of feature-oriented code quality analysis, often overlooked by mainstream tools due to the challenge of correlating high-level feature descriptions with low-level code implementations. To tackle this issue, we leverage existing feature location techniques to introduce a novel approach enabling granular analysis tailored to specific application features. We discuss the motivations for this approach, highlighting its potential to improve precision in enhancement and maintenance strategies. Additionally, this paper introduces a tool-based approach known as InsightMapper. We also present a study demonstrating the benefits of this method through the analysis of two case studies, featuring a recognized benchmark in the feature location domain.</p>

				<p>When applying model-driven engineering in an agile environment, new requirements continuously expand the domain scope and trigger an extension of the concepts covered by the Domain-Specific Language (DSL). While programming languages streamline code extension and reuse through libraries, similar approaches for DSLs are more complex or target a specific language. We present and discuss an approach for designing DSLs with a self-extension mechanism to enable model library creation and seamless reuse. We use the self-extension mechanism to introduce concepts in models, gather reusable models into a library, and provide an infrastructure for its usage. We explain our language-specific realization of the self-extension mechanism using a DSL and discuss model libraries of the DSL with a use case from practice. The approach provides more flexibility for agile model-driven engineering. It enables application modelers to introduce and reuse concepts via models without changing the DSL, reducing the communication overhead within the development team.</p>

P. OâBoyle</li></ul><div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline">
				<p>Inlining is a well-studied compiler transformation that can reduce call overhead and enable further optimizations. As functional programming languages such as Haskell have functions as first-class objects, they potentially have the most to gain from inlining. However, despite being acknowledged as one of the most important optimizations, there has been little recent work to significantly improve Haskellâs inlining heuristic for code performance.       This paper proposes a profile-directed technique to direct inlining decisions in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. We show that simply inlining âhotâ functions, as revealed by profiling summaries, does not lead to significant improvement. However, inlining along the hot dynamic call graph is frequently beneficial. Due to the higher-order nature of Haskell, determining this call graph is non-trivial. We develop a technique to extract call chains of hot functions and leverage the Glasgow Haskell Compilerâs existing functionality to safely influence inlining decisions through pragma placement along these chains.       We then show that hot call chain inlining yields a geometric mean speedup in run time of 9% over GHCâs default inlining heuristics across 17 real-world Haskell packages. This method can be used in the presence of pre-existing developer pragmas to produce a mean speedup of 10% across those same packages.</p>

				<p>This paper addresses the complexity of developing optimizing compilers by proposing a novel design pattern named Restage. The Restage interface reduces boilerplate code in transformation passes by simplifying the extraction and reconstruction of language constructs, thereby enabling more efficient and maintainable compiler development. This approach automatically generates the necessary interface instances using metaprogramming, minimizing manual effort. Additionally, the proposed solution integrates seamlessly with existing methodologies for building optimizing compilers, including strategy-based transformations and the visitor design pattern. The Restage design pattern significantly reduces the complexity and maintenance cost of compilers for generic-purpose and domain-specific languages.</p>

				<p>In recent years, Datalog has sparked renewed interest in academia and industry, leading to the development of numerous new Datalog systems. 
 
To unify these systems, recent approaches treat Datalog as an intermediate representation (IR) in a compiler framework:
 
Compiler frontends can lower different Datalog dialects to the same IR, which is then optimized before a compiler backend targets one of many existing Datalog engines.
 
However, a key feature is missing in these compiler frameworks: an expressive module system.
 
</p>
<p>
In this paper, we present the first module system for a Datalog IR.
 
Our modules are statically typed, can be separately compiled, and partially linked to form "bundles".
 
Since IR modules are generated by a compiler frontend, we rely on explicit declarations of required and provided relations to maximize the decoupling between modules.
 
This also allows modules to abstract over required relations to offer reusable functionality (e.g., computing a transitive closure) that can be instantiated for different relations in a single Datalog program.
 
We formalize the module system, its type system, and the linking algorithm.
 
We then describe how different usage patterns that occur in Datalog dialects (e.g., inheritance, cyclic imports) can be expressed in our IR module system.
 
Finally, we integrate our module system into an existing Datalog compiler framework, develop a SoufflÃ© compiler frontend that translates SoufflÃ© components to IR modules, and demonstrate its applicability to a large Doop analysis.</p>

				<p>Giving auto-completion candidates for dynamically typed languages requires complex analysis of the source code, especially when the goal is to ensure that the completion candidates do not introduce bugs. In this paper, we introduce an approach that builds upon abstract interpretation and the scope graph framework to obtain an over-approximation of the name binding seen at run-time. The over-approximation contains enough information to implement auto-completion services such that the given suggestions do not introduce name binding errors. To demonstrate our approach, we compare the suggestions given by our approach with the state of the art completion services on a subset of the Python programming language.</p>

				<p>Practical metaprogramming applications often involve manipulating open code fragments,

Many approaches have been proposed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to verify the type- and scope-safety of metaprograms,

imposing heavy type annotation or proof obligation burdens on metaprogrammers.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this short paper, we propose a new type system to statically keep track of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the context requirements of code fragments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our system uses a novel combination of Boolean-algebraic subtyping and first-class polymorphic type inference techniques
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to alleviate the annotation burden.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The former provides the ability to encode scope requirements as unions of types
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the latter allows these types to be locally quantified
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through a flexible form of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
polymorphic subtyping.
