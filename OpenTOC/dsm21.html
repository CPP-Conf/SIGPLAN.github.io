                  <p>Domain-specific modeling languages abstractly represent domain knowledge in a way
                     that users can more easily understand the model content without technical expertise.
                     These languages can be created for any domain, provided the necessary knowledge is
                     available. This research uses educational game design as a demonstration of the power
                     of domain-specific modeling. Games are useful tools in supplementing the traditional
                     education of students, however, many educators often do not possess the design or
                     technical skills to develop a custom game for their own use. MOLEGA (the Modeling
                     Language for Educational Card Games) is a domain-specific modeling language that provides
                     a guided model design environment for these users. Using MOLEGA, users can create
                     visual models, inspired by UML class diagrams, to represent their desired card game,
                     based on two selected variants. User models are then used to generate executable source
                     code for a mobile-compatible, browser-based game that can be deployed on a server
                     by following the provided instructions. MOLEGA is evaluated for validity and correctness
                     using a suite of example models.</p>

                  <p>We present PrintTalk, a DSL to "program" 3D objects, called "gadgets". PrintTalk also
                     features "topologies", which are predefined spacial arrangements of gadgets. Gadgets
                     are composed by executing a gadget script (possibly consisting of subscripts) that
                     'draws' the gadget in the 3D scene. However, executing the script also returns a number
                     of constraint variables. These variables can be constrained inside the gadget and
                     can also be bound outside the gadget in order to constrain the produced gadgets after
                     the facts. This is the essence of the gadget composition mechanism of PrintTalk. </p> 
                  <p> PrintTalk is implemented in DrRacket. Running a PrintTalk program generates a file
                     that is sent to the 3D printer. We validate PrintTalk qualitatively by comparing the
                     code for complex gadgets with the code needed to print those gadgets in existing languages.</p>

                  <p>At Philips IGT, we develop and produce interventional X-ray systems. For a controller
                     in these systems, we have an approximately five years old domain specific language.
                     Like general programming languages, domains specific languages also evolve. These
                     languages co-evolve together with their domain. The language used at IGT was initially
                     created for one system instance. Because of our positive experiences with the language,
                     we want to evolve the language to support a family of systems. In this paper, we report
                     on our experiences with the modifications we made to the original language. We made
                     these changes preserving the behavior of the existing system instance. To prevent
                     confidentiality issues, we use a Lego robot in our examples.</p>

                  <p>Domain-specific languages seek to provide domain guarantees that eliminate many errors
                     allowed by general-purpose languages. Still, a domain-specific language requires additional
                     quality assurance measures to ensure that specifications behave as intended by the
                     users. However, some domains may have specific quality assurance measures (e.g., proofs,
                     experiments, or case studies) with little tradition of using quality assurance measures
                     customary to software engineering. We investigate the possibility of accommodating
                     such domains by conducting a workshop with 11 prospective users of a domain-specific
                     language named MAL for the pension industry. The workshop emphasised the need for
                     supporting actuaries with new analytical tools for quality assurance and resulted
                     in three designs: quantity monitors let users identify outlier behaviour, fragment
                     debugging lets users debug with limited evaluative power, and debugging spreadsheets
                     let users visualise, analyse, and remodel concrete calculations with an established
                     domain tool. Based on our experiences, we hypothesise that co-design workshops are
                     a viable approach for DSLs in a similar situation.</p>

                  <p>Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) enables to verify the system performance using
                     system behavior models, which can identify design faults that do not meet the stakeholders’
                     requirements as early as possible, thus reducing the R&amp;D cost and error risks. Currently,
                     different domain engineers make use of different modeling languages to create their
                     own behavior models. Different behavior models are verified by different approaches.
                     It is difficult to adopt a unified integrated platform to support the modeling and
                     verification of heterogeneous behavior models during the conceptual design phase.
                     This paper proposes a unified modeling and verification approach supporting system
                     formalisms and verification. The KARMA language is used to support the unified formalisms
                     across MBSE models and dynamic simulations for different domain specific models. In
                     order to describe the behavior model more precisely and to facilitate verification,
                     the syntax of hybrid automata is integrated into KARMA. We implemented behavior models
                     and their verification in MetaGraph, a multi-architecture modeling tool. Finally,
                     the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by two cases: 1) the scenario
                     of booking railway tickets using BPMN models; 2) the behavior performance simulation
                     of unmanned vehicles using a SysML state machine diagram.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents our preliminary results developing an incremental query and transformation
                     engine for our modeling framework. Our prior framework combined WebGME, a cloud-based
                     collaborative modeling tool, with FORMULA, a language and tool for specifying and
                     analyzing domain-specific modeling languages. While this arrangement has been successful
                     for defining non-trivial languages in domains like CPS, one ongoing challenge is the
                     scalability of executing model queries and transformations on large models. The inherent
                     <em>incremental</em> nature of the modeling process exacerbates this scalability issue: model queries
                     and transformations are repeatedly performed on incrementally updated models. To address
                     this issue, we are developing an incremental version of FORMULA that can perform efficient
                     model queries and transformations in the face of continual model updates. This paper
                     describes our experiences designing this incremental version, including the challenges
                     we faced and design decisions. We also report encouraging benchmark results.</p>
