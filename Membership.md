SIGPLAN offers two membership options (electronic and print).

**Electronic Option**
<--- AF: I edited the paragraph below, based on BCP's comments. Also,
I changed the order to alphabetical. There was a random order before. --->

SIGPLAN members have access to all SIGPLAN publications in ACMâ€™s Digital
Library. This includes access to the proceedings of all SIGPLAN-sponsored
conferences. SIGPLAN sponsors four major annual conferences: the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), the Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), and the conference on Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications 
(SPLASH).  SIGPLAN also sponsors many additional conferences and workshops focused on specific areas of interest.


Other membership benefits include:

 *  Substantial discounts on registration for [SIGPLAN-sponsored conferences](/Conferences).
 *  Networking and leadership opportunities through participation in SIGPLAN-sponsored events.
 *  Opportunities for support toward achieving professional goals through the Professional Activities Committee [(PAC)](/PAC).

**TOC Service Available**

<!-- BCP: Probably dead? -->
<!-- AF: Yes, delete? -->

To receive the table of contents for each issue of SIGPLAN Notices as it is posted to the ACM Digital Library, sign up for the TOC Service. To do this, sign in using your ACM Web Log-In at www.acm.org or the ACM Digital Library. This step will automatically authenticate you as a member of SIGPLAN. In the [ACM Digital Library](http://www.acm.org/dl), on the right side of the page select Newsletters, and scroll down to SIGPLAN Notices. The link to the TOC Service is under the title in the box on the left.
Notice the TOC Service is also available for proceedings from SIGPLAN conferences.
Access to SIGPLAN materials in the ACM Digital Library is available as part of both Electronic and Print SIGPLAN memberships.
