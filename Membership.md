Not any more! -->) as well as the proceedings of all SIGPLAN-sponsored
conferences. SIGPLAN sponsors four major annual conferences: the OOPSLA
Conference on Object-Oriented Technology<!-- BCP: Should this say SPLASH 
instead of OOSPSLA? -->, the Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)-the major professional conference in the field, the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), and the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP). SIGPLAN also sponsors many additional conferences and workshops focused on specific areas of interest.
