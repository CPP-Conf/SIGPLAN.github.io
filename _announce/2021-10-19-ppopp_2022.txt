**PPoPP 2022 Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals**
https://ppopp22.sigplan.org/track/PPoPP-2022-workshops-and-tutorials

Dear Colleagues,

We are soliciting proposals for workshops and tutorials within the general scope of PPoPP. Members of the community are encouraged to submit proposals for workshops/tutorials that bring together researchers and practitioners to share their tools, technologies, latest results and to discuss work in progress and new directions.

PPoPP and the co-located conferences will most likely be held in a hybrid format in Seoul, Korea. We encourage workshop and tutorial organizers to attend and organize their events in-person; nevertheless, remote (online) organization is possible. Attendees can attend in-person or online.

**Important Dates:**
  * Workshop/Tutorials: February 12+13, 2022
  * Submission deadline: November 5, 2021
  * Notification: November 12, 2021

**Submission instructions:**
Proposals should include the following information:
  * Title of workshop/tutorial
  * Program:
    * Workshops: call for papers, scope, main topics, invited or keynote speakers, panel discussions, organizers’ bios and affiliations and a tentative list of PC members, whether or not accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library
    * Tutorials: abstract, outline of content and objectives, prerequisite knowledge, special requirements, organizers’ bios, affiliations, and relevant experience to the topic
  * Duration of the workshop (half day/full day) and maximum number of participants
  * Advertisement: how do you plan to solicit participation
  * Information on past workshops/tutorials on the same topic incl. participation statistics

Submit your proposals in PDF format by or before November 5 to the Workshops and Tutorials Chair, Bernhard Egger (bernhard@csap.snu.ac.kr). Early submissions are encouraged - proposals are reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis.

Feel free to contact Bernhard with questions about the suitability of a workshop/tutorial for PPoPP or for any other related matters.
