26th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                       and affiliated events

                    August 22 - August 27, 2021
                               Online

                 Early Registration until August 7!

=====================================================================

ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire
spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries.

This year, the conference will be a virtual event. All activities will
take place online.

The main conference will take place from August 23-25, 2021 during two
time bands. The first band will be 4PM-11PM Seoul time, and will
include both technical and social activities.  The second band will
repeat (with some variation) the technical program and social
activities 12 hours later, 3PM-10PM New York, the following day.

Weâ€™re excited to announce that ICFP 2021 will feature an invited talk
from Ravi Chugh of the University of Chicago. Keynote sessions will
take place at 10 PM Seoul/9 AM New York. 

ICFP has officially accepted 35 exciting papers, and (in its second
year) there will also be presentations of 4 papers accepted recently
to the Journal of Functional Programming. Co-located symposia and
workshops will take place the day before and two days immediately
after the main conference.

Registration is now open. The early registration deadline is August
7th, 2021.  Registration is not free, but is significantly lower than
usual, including a $10 discounted registration option available to
all. Students who are ACM or SIGPLAN members may register for FREE
before the early deadline.
