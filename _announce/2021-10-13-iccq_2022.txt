title: "Call for Papers, 2nd International Conference on Code Quality (ICCQ 2022) in-coop with SIGPLAN"
timestamp: "10/13/2021 10:36:40"
deadline: "12/18/2021"

We organize ICCQ conference because we believe that the quality of the source code that millions of programmers write every day could be much higher than it is now. We believe that the contribution computer science can make to improve this situation is greatly undervalued. We aim to solve this problem by gathering together cutting-edge researchers and letting them share their most recent ideas on static analysis, program verification, bug detection, and software maintenance.

The conference is done in cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN/SIGSOFT and IEEE Computer Society.

The conference will be done online: you will be presenting your work over Zoom.
