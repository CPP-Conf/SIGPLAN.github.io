Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world. Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints.

The 24th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2023) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted to https://lctes23.hotcrp.com/.


Important Dates

* Paper submission deadline: March 16, 2023 (firm deadline)
* Paper notification: April 21, 2023
* Artifact submission deadline: May 1, 2023
* Artifact decision: May 12, 2023
* Camera-ready deadline: May 15, 2023
* Conference: June 18, 2023


Paper Categories

* Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work.
* Work-in-progress paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions.

Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES introduces two journal modes.

* All accepted full papers will be invited to be published in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process.
* Rejected full papers may have the option to submit their work to the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL; 4 pages). IEEE ESL submissions will undergo a separate review process.


Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest including, but not limited to:

Programming language challenges
* Domain-specific languages
* Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging
  architectures
* Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems
