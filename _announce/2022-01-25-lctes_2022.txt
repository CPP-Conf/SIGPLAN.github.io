## LCTES 2022 Call for Papers

[https://pldi22.sigplan.org/track/LCTES-2022](https://pldi22.sigplan.org/track/LCTES-2022)

Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world. Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up to multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints.

[LCTES 2022](https://pldi22.sigplan.org/track/LCTES-2022) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted through [HotCRP](https://lctes2022.hotcrp.com/).

Important Dates:

-   Paper submission deadline: March 7, 2022
    
-   Paper notification: April 8, 2022
    
-   Artifact submission: April 16, 2022
    
-   Artifact decision: May 2, 2022
    
-   Camera-ready deadline: May 6, 2022
    
-   Conference: June 21, 2022
    

Paper Categories:

-   Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work.
    
-   Work-in-progress paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions.
    

Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM.

LCTES 2022 provides a journal mode in addition to the usual conference mode. Accepted full papers will be selectively invited to be published in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS).
