Student Travel Grant for PPoPP, CGO, and HPCA 2024

Please consider applying for the student travel grant program to attend the prestigious colocated international symposia on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO), Principles and Practices of Parallel Programming (PPoPP) and High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA).  This year, all 3 symposia will be colocated in Edinburgh, Scotland from March 2-6, 2024.

Thanks to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other sources, the conferences have funding to support student travel grants to defray the cost of attending.

We encourage all in need of a travel grant to apply.  Selection of grantees will be based on need, participation in the symposia (e.g. papers or posters), and to encourage a diversity of attendees.

Please make an application via this form:

* An estimate of conference-related expenses is required.
* Information about other sources of funding available to supplement the travel grant must be provided.
* Written confirmation from the studentâ€™s advisor must be supplied with the application.
