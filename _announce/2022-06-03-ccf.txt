We're seeking nominations for the selection committee for the Computing Connections Fellowship! In brief, this fellowship will provide institution-independent transitional funding for PhD students looking for help escaping an unhealthy work environment to visit another institution while looking for a more long-term solution. The pilot program will be focused on PhD students working in PL or a closely related area.

Selection Committee Nominations Form:

The expected responsibilities of the committee include: reading applications confidentially to determine need, working individually with applicants to discuss their situation, and selecting recipients for funding on a rolling basis. Self-nominations are welcome, and PhD students are also welcome to volunteer!

Please reach out to Talia Ringer <tringer@illinois.edu> or Caleb Stanford <castan@cis.upenn.edu> if you have any questions!
