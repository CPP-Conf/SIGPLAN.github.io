# TFP 2025 – Call for Papers
(trendsfp.github.io)

## Important Dates

Submission deadline (pre-symposium, full papers): Wed 13th Nov 2024 (AOE)
Notification        (pre-symposium, full papers): Wed 11th Dec 2024
Submission deadline (pre-symposium draft papers): Wed 11th Dec 2024 (AOE)
Notification        (pre-symposium draft papers): Mon 16th Dec 2024
Submission deadline (post-symposium review):      Wed 19th Feb 2025 (AOE)
Notification        (post-symposium submissions): Wed 26th Mar 2025

The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international 
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional programming, 
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to be 
a lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and other 
contributions.

This year, TFP will take place in-person at the University of Oxford, UK. It 
is co-located with the Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE) 
workshop, which will take on the day before the main symposium.

Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, 13th 
November, is for authors who wish to have their full paper reviewed prior to 
the symposium. Papers that are accepted in this way must also be presented at 
the symposium. The second, 11th December, is for authors who wish to present 
their work or work-in-progress at the symposium first without submitting to 
the full review process for publication. These authors can then take into 
account feedback received at the symposium and submit a full paper for review 
by the third deadline, 19th February.

## Scope

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes. As 
part of the Symposium’s focus on trends we therefore identify the following five 
paper categories. High-quality submissions are solicited in any of these 
categories:

*   Research Papers: Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
*   Position Papers: On what new trends should or should not be
*   Project Papers: Descriptions of recently started new projects
*   Evaluation Papers: What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
*   Overview Papers: Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication to any 
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: theoretical, 
implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of functional 
programming techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the 
symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

*   Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
*   Functional programming in the cloud
*   High performance functional computing
*   Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
*   Dependently typed functional programming
*   Validation and verification of functional programs
*   Debugging and profiling for functional languages
*   Functional programming in different application areas: 
    security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded systems, 
    global computing, grids, etc.
*   Interoperability with imperative programming languages
*   Novel memory management techniques
*   Program analysis and transformation techniques
*   Empirical performance studies
*   Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
*   (Embedded) domain specific languages
*   New implementation strategies
*   Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP, please 
contact the programme chair, Jeremy Gibbons.

## Best Paper Awards

TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.

First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best overall 
paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.

Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. TFP 
traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging that 
students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student paper is 
one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of students, 
the students are the paper’s first authors, and a student would present the paper.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the best paper 
happens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.

## Instructions to Authors

Submission is via EquinOCS (https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/tfp2025).

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally reviewed 
either before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium submissions may either 
be full (earlier deadline) or draft papers (later deadline).

## Pre-symposium formal review

Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted before the 
early deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of acceptance for 
both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that has been 
rejected for publication but accepted for presentation may be revised and resubmitted 
for the post-symposium formal review.

## Post-symposium formal review

Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance for 
presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit 
revised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A post-symposium 
refereeing process will then select a subset of these papers for formal publication.

## Paper categories

Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as extended 
abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (up to 20 pages). The submission 
must clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, project, 
evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors are research 
students, and whether the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all 
authors are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members 
shortly after the symposium has taken place.

## Format

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For more 
information about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS Guidelines web site
(https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
