title: "Call for Nominations: Dahl-Nygaard Prize"
---
We are seeking nominations for the Dahl-Nygaard prize for the 2023 year.

In 2004, AITO established an annual prize in the name of the Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard to honor their pioneering work on object-orientation. The prizes are named after Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard, whose pioneering conceptual and technical work in the sixties shaped that view of programming and modeling which is now known as object-orientation.

One prize is awarded to a junior researcher (who has obtained the PhD degree at most 7 years before the award year, excluding any parental leave), and one prize to a senior researcher. The senior researcher should have made a significant long-term contribution to the field in research or engineering. The junior researcher should have made a promising contribution to the field through a paper, a thesis, or a prototype implementation.

Nominations are due by December 15 and should be made using the following online form:

Best regards,

Dahl-Nygaard prize committee chair, 2023
