*** General Information

The 28th Ada-Europe International Conference on Reliable Software
Technologies (AEiC 2024) will take place in Barcelona, Spain.

AEiC is a leading international forum for providers, practitioners,
and researchers in reliable software technologies.  The conference
presentations will illustrate current work in the theory and practice
of the design, development, and maintenance of long-lived, high-quality
software systems for a challenging variety of application domains.
The program will also include keynotes, Q&A and discussion sessions,
and social events.  Participants include practitioners and researchers
from industry, academia, and government organizations active in the
development of reliable software technologies.

The topics of interest for the conference include but are not limited
to (more specific topics are described on the conference web page):
* Formal and Model-Based Engineering of Critical Systems;
* High-Integrity Systems and Reliability;
* AI for High-Integrity Systems Engineering;
* Real-Time Systems;
* Ada Language;
* Applications in Relevant Domains.

The conference comprises different tracks and co-located events:
* Journal track papers present research advances supported by solid
  theoretical foundation and thorough evaluation.
* Industrial track contributions highlight industrial open challenges
  and/or the practitioners' side of a relevant case study or industrial
  project.
* Work-in-progress track papers illustrate novel research ideas
  that are still at an initial stage, between conception and first
  prototype.
* Tutorials guide attenders through a hands-on familiarization with
  innovative developments or with useful features related to reliable
  software.
* Workshops provide discussion forums on themes related to the
  conference topics.
* Vendor presentations and exhibitions allow for companies to showcase
  their latest products and services.

*** Call for Journal Track Submissions

Following a journal-first model, this edition of the conference
includes a journal track, which seeks original and high-quality
papers that describe mature research work on the conference topics.
Accepted journal track papers will be published in a Special Issue
of Elsevier JSA - the Journal of Systems Architecture (Q1 ranked,
CiteScore 8.5, impact factor 4.5).  Accordingly, the conference
is listed as "Journal Published" in the latest update of the CORE
Conference Ranking released in August 2023.  Contributions must be
submitted by 15 January 2024.  Submissions should be made online at
https://www.editorialmanager.com/jsa/, selecting the "Ada-Europe AEiC
2024" option (submission page open from 15 November 2023) as article
type of the paper.  General information for submitting to the JSA
can be found at the Journal of Systems Architecture website.

JSA has adopted the Virtual Special Issue model to speed up the
publication process, where Special Issue papers are published in
regular issues, but marked as SI papers.  Acceptance decisions
are made on a rolling basis.  Therefore, authors are encouraged to
submit papers early, and need not wait until the submission deadline.
Authors who have successfully passed the first round of review will
be invited to present their work at the conference.  The abstract of
the accepted contributions will be included in the conference booklet.

The Ada-Europe organization will waive the Open Access fees for
the first four accepted papers (whose authors do not already enjoy
Open Access agreements).  Subsequent papers will follow JSA regular
publishing track.  Prospective authors may direct all enquiries
regarding this track to the corresponding chairs, Bjorn Andersson
(baandersson@sei.cmu.edu) and Luis Miguel Pinho (lmp@isep.ipp.pt).

*** Call for Industrial Track Submissions

The conference seeks industrial practitioner presentations that deliver
insight on the challenges of developing reliable software.  Especially
welcome kinds of submissions are listed on the conference website.
Given their applied nature, such contributions will be subject to a
dedicated practitioner-peer review process.  Interested authors shall
submit a 1-to-2 pages abstract, by 26 February 2024, via EasyChair
at https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=aeic2024, selecting the
"Industrial Track".  The format for submission is strictly in PDF,
following the Ada User Journal style.  Templates are available at
http://www.ada-europe.org/auj/guide.

The abstract of the accepted contributions will be included in the
conference booklet.  The corresponding authors will get a presentation
slot in the prime-time technical program of the conference and will
also be invited to expand their contributions into full-fledged
articles for publication in the Ada User Journal, which will form the
proceedings of the industrial track of the Conference.  Prospective
authors may direct all enquiries regarding this track to its chairs
Luciana Provenzano (luciana.provenzano@mdu.se) and Michael Pressler
(Michael.Pressler@de.bosch.com).

*** Call for Work-in-Progress Track Submissions

The work-in-progress track seeks two kinds of submissions: (a) ongoing
research and (b) early-stage ideas.  Ongoing research submissions
are 4-page papers describing research results that are not mature
enough to be submitted to the journal track.  Early-stage ideas are
1-page papers that pitch new research directions that fall within
the scope of the conference.  Both kinds of submissions must be
original and shall undergo anonymous peer review.  Submissions
by recent MSc graduates and PhD students are especially sought.
Authors shall submit their work by 26 February 2024, via EasyChair
at https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=aeic2024, selecting the
"Work-in-Progress Track".  The format for submission is strictly in
PDF, following the Ada User Journal style.  Templates are available
at http://www.ada-europe.org/auj/guide.

The abstract of the accepted contributions will be included in the
conference booklet.  The corresponding authors will get a presentation
slot in the prime-time technical program of the conference and
will also be offered the opportunity to expand their contributions
into 4-page articles for publication in the Ada User Journal,
which will form the proceedings of the WiP track of the Conference.
Prospective authors may direct all enquiries regarding this track
to the corresponding chairs Alejandro R. Mosteo (amosteo@unizar.es)
and Ruben Martins (rubenm@andrew.cmu.edu).

*** Awards

The organization will offer an honorary award for the best technical
presentation, to be announced in the closing session of the conference.

*** Call for Tutorials

The conference seeks tutorials in the form of educational seminars
on themes falling within the conference scope, with an academic or
practitioner slant, including hands-on or practical elements.  Tutorial
proposals shall include a title, an abstract, a description of the
topic, an outline of the presentation, the proposed duration (half-day
or full-day), the intended level of the contents (introductory,
intermediate, or advanced), and a statement motivating attendance.
Tutorial proposals shall be submitted at any time but no later
than the 26 February 2024 to the respective chair Maria A. Serrano
(maria.serrano@nearbycomputing.com), with subject line: "[AEiC 2024:
tutorial proposal]".  Once submitted, each tutorial proposal will
be evaluated by the conference organizers as soon as possible,
with decisions from January 1st.  The authors of accepted full-day
tutorials will receive a complimentary conference registration, halved
for half-day tutorials.  The Ada User Journal will offer space for
the publication of summaries of the accepted tutorials.

*** Call for Workshops

The conference welcomes satellite workshops centred on themes that fall
within the conference scope.  Proposals may be submitted for half- or
full-day events, to be scheduled at either end of the AEiC conference.
Workshop organizers shall also commit to producing the proceedings of
the event, for publication in the Ada User Journal.  Workshop proposals
shall be submitted at any time but no later than the 26 February
2024 to the respective chair Sergio Saez (ssaez@disca.upv.es), with
subject line: "[AEiC 2024: workshop proposal]".  Once submitted, each
workshop proposal will be evaluated by the conference organizers as
soon as possible, with decisions from January 1st.
