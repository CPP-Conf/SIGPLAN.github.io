Dear All,

TFPIE 2022 invites you to attend the conference on March 16 online. The program and the registration link are posted here:

https://wiki.tfpie.science.ru.nl/TFPIE2022

Registration is free, but required for the zoom link to be sent. 

TFPIE is followed by TFP on March 17-18: https://trendsfp.github.io/index.html The registration is the same for the two conferences. 

More details:

The 2022 edition of Trends in Functional Programming in Education will be held virtually on March 16th 2022, together with TFP which will be held on March 17-18. Note that Lambda Days in Krakow, Poland has been rescheduled to July 28-29, and authors of TFPIE accepted papers are welcome to present their papers at the Lambda Days, in addition to the virtual presentations in March.

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals that use, or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education. TFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progress on the use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for publication after the workshop. 


Hope to see you there!

Elena Machkasova
