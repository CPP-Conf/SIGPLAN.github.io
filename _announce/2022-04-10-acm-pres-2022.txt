The 2022 Candidates for ACM President, Yannis Ioannidis and Joe Konstan, are attempting to set a new precedent for ACM elections. They are working together to solicit and answer questions from the computing community! While only ACM members can vote, you do not have to be an ACM member to suggest questions.

In addition to providing an official statement of their own to appear with the ACM election materials, they have agreed to answer a set of questions posed by community members. Questions are being collected through a Google form and through a forum at OnlineQuestions.org (Event 202204).

The questions will be collected/collated/edited by moderators, currently Jeanna Matthews, Nuria Oliver, and Moshe Vardi, and a final set of questions will be posted. The candidates will prepare answers independently and those answers will also be posted.
