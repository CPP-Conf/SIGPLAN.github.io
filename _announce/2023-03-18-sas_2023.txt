--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 30th Static Analysis Symposium, SAS 2023, will be co-located with
SPLASH 2023 in Cascais (Lisbon), Portugal.

Static Analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program
verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and
software maintenance. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served as the
primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application
advances in the area.

- Full paper submission: April 24, 2023 
- Artifact submission: April 29, 2023

The technical program for SAS 2023 will consist of invited lectures
and presentations of refereed papers. Contributions are welcomed on
all aspects of static analysis, including, but not limited to:

Abstract interpretation
Automated deduction
Data flow analysis
Debugging techniques
Deductive methods
Emerging applications
Model-checking
Data science
Program optimizations and transformations
Program synthesis
Program verification
Machine learning and verification
Security analysis
Tool environments and architectures
Theoretical frameworks
Type checking
Distributed or networked systems


PAPER SUBMISSION

All paper submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance,
correctness, originality, and clarity. 

Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sas2023

We welcome regular papers as well as papers focusing on any of the
following in the NEAT (New questions/areas, Experience, Announcement,
Tool) category:

- Well-motivated discussion of new questions or new areas. 
- Experience with static analysis tools, Industrial Reports, and Case Studies 
- Brief announcements of work in progress 
- Tool papers 

We do not impose a page limit for submitted papers but we encourage
brevity as reviewers have a limited time that they can spend on each
paper. With the exception of experience papers, all other papers will
follow a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  The identity of
the authors for the remaining papers will be known to the reviewers.

Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including
concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic,
object-oriented, aspect, multi-core, distributed, and GPU
programming.

Papers must be written and presented in English. A submitted paper
must describe original work and must not substantially overlap with
papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted
to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings.

All submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance,
relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The review process
will include a rebuttal period where authors have the opportunity to
respond to preliminary reviews on the paper.

RADHIA COUSOT AWARD

The program committee will select an accepted regular paper for the Radhia
Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award in memory of Radhia Cousot and her
fundamental contributions to static analysis, as well as being one of the main
promoters and organizers of the SAS series of conferences.

ARTIFACTS

As in previous years, we encourage authors to submit a virtual machine image
containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. Artifact
submission is optional. Artifact evaluation will be concurrent with paper
review.
