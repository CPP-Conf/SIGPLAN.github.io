10th International Conference on Behavioural and Social Computing (BESC 2023)

October 30 - November 1, 2023, 5* Golden Bay Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus

http://besc-conf.org/2023/


The International Conference on Behavioural and Social Computing (BESC) is a major 
international forum that brings together academic researchers and industry practitioners from
artificial intelligence, computational social sciences, natural language processing, business
and marketing, and behavioural and psychological sciences to present updated research
efforts and progresses on foundational and emerging interdisciplinary topics of BESC,
exchange new ideas and identify future research directions.

The BESC series of conferences are technically sponsored by IEEE SMC (Systems, Man and
Cybernetics) Society as well as IEEE CIS (Computational Intelligence Society) (currently pending
approval for the 2023 edition) and the proceedings are published by IEEE

BESC 2023 invites submissions of original, high-quality research papers addressing
cutting-edge developments from all areas of behavioural and social computing. The
conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to 
share their knowledge, experience, and perspectives on the latest trends, challenges, and 
opportunities in this rapidly evolving field. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

The paper submission system is using Easy Chair and the submission link is:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=besc2023 .

All papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, 
relevance to BESC 2023, originality, significance and clarity.

Please note:
• All submissions should use IEEE two-column style. Templates are available here:
https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html
• All papers must be submitted electronically through the paper submission system in PDF 
format only. BESC 2023 accepts research papers (6 pages), special session papers (6 pages)
and Doctoral Symposium papers (4 pages).
• The page count above excludes the references (but includes any appendices).
• Paper review will be double-blind, and submissions not properly anonymized will be
desk-rejected without review.
• Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or
that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.
• Papers must be clearly submitted in English and will be selected based on their originality, 
timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation.
• Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be 
accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the
work.
• All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore and indexed by EI. Top quality papers
after presented in the conference will be selected for extension and publication in several
special issues of international journals, e.g., World Wide Web Journal (Springer), Web
Intelligence (IOS Press), and Social Network Analysis and Mining (Springer), Human-Centric
Intelligent Systems (Springer), Information Discovery and Delivery (Emerald Publishing).


SPECIAL SESSION PROPOSALS

The Organizing Committee invites proposals for Special Sessions that cover any topic related
to BESC. Special Sessions can also cover any other area focusing on challenging open problems
of relevance in applications on Behavioural, Economic, and Socio-Cultural Computing. 

Papers accepted in the Special Sessions will be included in the same conference volume with 
those accepted in the main track and will be candidates for being invited to the journal special 
issues that will be organised for BESC 2023.

The proposals for organising Special Sessions should be submitted to the Special Sessions
Chairs by the indicated deadline. A proposal should be submitted in PDF, be no longer than 2
pages in length, and contain the following:
(i) Title of the proposed Special Session.
(ii) Names, affiliations and contact information of the proposers.
(iii) Names and affiliations of the Program Committee of the proposed Special Session.
(iv) Description of the proposed Special Session, including the covered topics and the rationale
as to why it fits into the themes of BESC.
(v) A dissemination plan of the CFP for the proposed Special Session that the proposers will 
undertake, if their proposal is accepted.
