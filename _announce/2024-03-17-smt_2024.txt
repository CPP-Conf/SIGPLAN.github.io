SMT 2024: 22nd International Workshop on Satisfiability Modulo Theories
Montreal, Canada, July 22-23, 2024
========================================================

Paper Submission: April 28, 2024 11.59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth)
Notification: June 1, 2024
Conference website   http://smt-workshop.cs.uiowa.edu/2024/
Submission link      https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=smt2024

== Overview
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and users of SMT tools and techniques. Relevant topics include but are not limited to:
- Decision procedures and theories of interest
- Combinations of decision procedures
- Novel implementation techniques
- Applications and case studies
- Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies
- Theoretical results

== Paper submission and Proceedings

Three categories of submissions are invited:

1. Extended abstracts : given the informal style of the workshop, we strongly encourage the submission of preliminary reports of work in progress. They may range in length from very short (a couple of pages) to the full 10 pages and they will be judged based on the expected level of interest for the SMT community. They will be included in the informal proceedings.

2. Original papers: contain original research (simultaneous submissions are not allowed) and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the submission. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available.

3. Presentation-only papers: describe work recently published or submitted and will not be included in the proceedings. We see this as a way to provide additional access to important developments that SMT Workshop attendees may be unaware of.

Papers in all three categories will be peer-reviewed. Extended abstracts and original papers should not exceed 10 pages. All papers should be in standard-conforming PDF. Technical details may be included in an appendix to be read at the reviewers' discretion. Final versions should be prepared in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class file. (The 10 page limit does not include references.). Presentation-only papers may be submitted as originally published, if published elsewhere, and should not exceed 10 pages otherwise.
