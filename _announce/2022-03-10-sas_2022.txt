The 28th Static Analysis Symposium, SAS 2022, will be co-located with SPLASH
2022 in Auckland, New Zealand.

Static Analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program
verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and
software maintenance. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served as the
primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application
advances in the area.

PAPER SUBMISSION

All paper submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance,
correctness, originality, and clarity. 
Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sas2022 
We welcome regular papers as well as papers focusing on any of the following: 
* Experience with static analysis tools, Industrial Reports, and Case Studies 
* Tool papers 
* Brief announcements of work in progress 
* Well-motivated discussion of new questions or new areas. 
We do not impose a page limit for submitted papers but we encourage brevity as
reviewers have a limited time that they can spend on each paper. With the
exception of experience papers, all other papers will follow a lightweight
double-blind reviewing process.

RADHIA COUSOT AWARD

The program committee will select an accepted regular paper for the Radhia
Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award in memory of Radhia Cousot and her
fundamental contributions to static analysis, as well as being one of the main
promoters and organizers of the SAS series of conferences.

ARTIFACTS

As in previous years, we encourage authors to submit a virtual machine image
containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. Artifact
submission is optional. Artifact evaluation will be concurrent with paper
review.
