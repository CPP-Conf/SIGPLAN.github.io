19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software
Engineering (TASE 2025)

July 14-16, 2025, 5* St. Raphael Resort and Marina, Limassol, Cyprus

https://cyprusconferences.org/tase2025/

(*** Proceedings to be published by Springer in LNCS ***)


OVERVIEW

TASE 2025 aims to bring together researchers and developers from academia and industry with
interest in the theoretical aspects of software engineering. Modern society is increasingly
dependent on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This poses new
challenges to current software engineering methodologies that need to be enhanced using
modern results from theoretical computer science. We invite submission of research papers on
topics covering all theoretical aspects of software engineering, including those describing
applications of theoretical computer science in industrial applications and software engineering
methodologies.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Authors are invited to submit high quality technical papers describing original and unpublished
work in all theoretical aspects of software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

Software engineering, including:
■ Software processes and workflows
■ Software architectures and design
■ Software product lines
■ Requirements engineering
■ Model-driven software engineering
■ Software testing and quality assurance
■ Software safety, security and reliability
■ Reverse engineering and software maintenance
■ Component-based software engineering
■ Feature-oriented programming
■ Program synthesis
■ Use of AI and large language models in software engineering

Formal methods and theoretical computer science, including:
■ Deductive verification
■ Model checking
■ Theorem proving, decision procedures, SAT and SMT
■ Specification languages
■ Program logics and calculi
■ Formal languages and automata theory
■ Run-time verification and monitoring
■ Integration of formal methods
■ Formal methods for AI systems, and vice versa

Programming language design and technology, including:
■ Formal semantics
■ Abstract interpretation and program analysis
■ Language paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, declarative, etc.
■ Type systems and behavioral typing
■ Compiler design
■ Domain-specific languages

Tools and application areas, including:
■ Software tools putting theory into practice
■ Cyber-physical, embedded, and real-time systems
■ Distributed and concurrent systems
■ Semantic web and web services
■ Service-oriented programming and cloud computing
■ Quantum circuits and programs
■ Cryptographic algorithms


SUBMISSION

Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be concurrently considered for
publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to
the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The proceedings
will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Papers should be
written in English and should not exceed 16 pages (excluding bibliography) for long papers and
6 pages (excluding bibliography) for short papers in LNCS format. Submissions should be made
through the TASE 2025 submission page, handled by the Easy Chair conference management
system.

The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions
of their papers to a special issue in the journal Science of Computer Programming
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming).
