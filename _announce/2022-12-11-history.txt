title: 'ACM History Committee 2023 CFP: History and Archiving Fellowships'
---
The ACM History Committee’s call for proposals for the history and archiving fellowship program is now open. This year, there’s more focus on SIG history as we incorporate our support of SIG Heritage and archiving more directly in the CFP.

The full call can be found in the link:

The deadline for submissions is February 15th, 2023. 

The ACM History Committee’s 2023 fellowship competition is for research and archiving projects on or centrally-related to ACM history. The History Committee plans to support up to four projects with awards up to $4,000.  The History Committee has awarded over 40 fellowships since the start of this fellowship program in 2009.
