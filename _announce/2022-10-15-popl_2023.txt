POPL 23 -- Call for Student Volunteers

POPL (https://popl23.sigplan.org/) is a leading forum for the discussion
of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems,
from theoretical to experimental aspects. In order to smoothly run the
conference and associated workshops and tutorials, we need student
volunteers to help out on the practical aspect of the organization. All the
events associated with POPL â€™23 will take place from Sun 15 to Sat 21
January 2023 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

The student volunteer program is a chance for students from around the
world to participate in the conferences whilst assisting us in preparing
and running the events. In return, volunteers are granted free registration
to the conferences, tutorials, workshops, and all associated events.

As a POPL 2023 Student Volunteer, you will interact closely with
researchers, academics and practitioners from various disciplines and meet
other students from around the world.

Job assignments for student volunteers include:
assisting with technical sessions, workshops, tutorials and panels,
checking badges at doors, operating the information desk, providing
information about the conference to attendees, helping with traffic flow,
and general assistance to keep the conference running smoothly.
