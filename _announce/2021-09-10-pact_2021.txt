We invite you to participate in the virtual PACT 2021 conference. 
It starts with a workshop on September 26 and continues with 
a tutorial on September 27 and the main conference during 
September 27th – 29th. We have an exciting program this year 
with one keynote talk (Saman Amarasinghe, MIT) and 25 papers. 
The details are on the PACT 2021 website (http://pactconf.org/) 
where you can register for the conference. We look forward to your 
participation.

Scope:

Sitting at the intersection of parallel architectures and compilers, 
the PACT conference series brings together researchers from 
architecture, compilers, execution environments, programming 
languages, and applications to present and discuss their latest 
research results.
