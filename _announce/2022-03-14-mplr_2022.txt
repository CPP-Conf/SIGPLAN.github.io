               MPLR 2022 - 19th International Conference
              on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes

            September 14-16, 2022 in Brussels, Belgium

========================================================================

The 19th International Conference on Managed Programming Languages &
Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang) is a premier forum for presenting and
discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages
and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most
important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and
real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms)
and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).

This year, MPLR will be held at the campus of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel(VUB) in Brussels, Belgium. 

For up-to-date details, check out the conference website:
https://soft.vub.ac.be/mplr22/ and follow us on Twitter @MPLR_Conf.

The areas of interest include but are not limited to:

 * Languages and Compilers
    -  Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …)
    - Portable intermediate representations like Webassembly  
    - Domain-specific languages
    - Language design
    - Compilers and interpreters
    - Type systems and program logics
    - Language interoperability
    - Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency

 * Virtual Machines
    - Managed runtime systems (e.g., JVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, LLVM, .NET CLR, RPython, GraalVM, etc.)
    - VM design and optimization
    - VMs for mobile and embedded devices
    - VMs for real-time applications
    - Memory management and garbage collection
    - Hardware/software co-design

 * Techniques, Tools, and Applications
    - Static and dynamic program analysis
    - Testing and debugging
    - Refactoring
    - Program understanding
    - Program synthesis
    - Security and privacy
    - Performance analysis and monitoring
    - Compiler and program verification


Submission Categories
---------------------

MPLR accepts four types of submissions:

 1. Regular research papers
      describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms.
      Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance,
      novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art.

   Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix

 2. Work-in-progress research papers
      describing promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full
      Papers.
      Work-in-progress papers will be  evaluated with an emphasis on novelty
      and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and
      experimental results.

   Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix

 3. Industry and tool papers
      presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language
      platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems.
      Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance,
      usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability
      will also be considered for tool papers.

    Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix

 4. Posters and Demonstrations
      They will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers.
      Posters can accompany any submission as a way to provide additional
      demonstration and discussion opportunities.
  
    Format: poster and 1-page abstract

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.

MPLR 2022 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication
and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy.
See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/


Author Instructions
-------------------

Submissions need to use the ACM `acmart` format with the `sigconf` style:
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the 'acmart' document class with the ‘sigplan’ option. For reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission
using the LaTeX command `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`.
The standard settings of a 10 point font size.

All submissions need to be in PDF format.

MPLR uses single-blind reviewing, i.e., author names are generally included in submissions.

Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black
and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct
and font sizes are legible.
