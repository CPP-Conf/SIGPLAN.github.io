SPLASH-E is a symposium, started in 2013, for software and languages (SE/PL) researchers with activities and interests around computing education. Some build pedagogically-oriented languages or tools; some think about pedagogic challenges around SE/PL courses; some bring computing to non-CS communities; some pursue human studies and educational research.

At SPLASH-E, we share our educational ideas and challenges centered in software/languages, as well as our best ideas for advancing such work. SPLASH-E strives to bring together researchers and those with educational interests that arise from software ideas or concerns.
