PACT 2022 invites students to participate in the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC). The SRC is a forum for graduate and undergraduate students to share their research results, exchange ideas, and improve their communication skills while competing for prizes. The SRC consists of three rounds: (1) an online abstract submission, (2) a poster session at PACT 2022 for accepted abstracts, and (3) a presentation at PACT 2022 by poster session finalists.

All authors of accepted abstracts will receive free conference registration to PACT (October 10-12, 2022, in Chicago), to help offset costs of attendance. Students must attend PACT 2022 in person to take part in the poster session and finalist presentation.

Student winners receive prizes of $500, $300, and $200 for first/second/third place, respectively, in each of the undergraduate and graduate divisions, along with a framed certificate.

800-word poster abstracts are due September 1, 2022 (AoE), and authors are expected to be notified on September 15.
