### Important dates

Volunteer applications Deadline:          Tue Jul 30, 2024
Notification of Acceptance:               Wed Aug 7, 2024



Apply to be a Volunteer and help us make SPLASH 2024 a great experience 
for all attendants!

SPLASH 2024 is pleased to offer a number of opportunities for volunteers, 
who are vital to the efficient operation and continued success of the 
conference each year. The volunteer program is a chance for students and 
Programming Languages researchers aspirants from around the world to 
participate in the conferences while assisting us in preparing and 
running the event.

The Volunteer Program helps more people attend the SPLASH conference by 
covering conference fees, including access to the banquet (but not travel 
or lodging expenses), in exchange for a fixed number of work hours 
(usually from 12 to 15) helping with the conference organization.




### Eligibility criteria

Everyone is welcome to apply. Priority is given to junior members of our 
community, e.g. full- or part-time students of computer science and 
related fields.


### Duration

Applicants must be available for at least five (5) full days between 
October 20th and October 25th 2024, and will be expected to provide 
12-15 hours of volunteering work in that time. Volunteers may also be 
expected to be available for some amount of pre-conference discussion and 
training if necessary. Volunteers from all timezones are welcome.


### About Volunteering

The skills, talents, and dedication of our Volunteers contribute to the 
overall quality of the conference.

The Volunteer role this year will mainly involve working with the organizers 
to prepare for the conference by providing technical assistance to attendees, 
managing online Q&A and poster sessions, and supporting active communication 
in our online environment.

Volunteering allows you to meet other people (faculty and students) in the 
Programming Languages (PL) Community. With several opportunities for networking, 
you can share ideas about your research, find topics you are passionate about, 
investigate career paths, and even find your future collaborators!


### Compensation

- A Complimentary Conference Registration, offering access to all open sessions 
(i.e., parallel paper presentations, demonstrations, and workshops) and conference 
proceedings.
- Free lunches and refreshments during breaks.
- Volunteer shirt.
- Free admission to all social events.
