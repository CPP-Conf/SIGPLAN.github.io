Dear Colleague,

I'm writing to seek your help in generating awareness of and interest in the [11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF)](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/).

HLF is where "Laureates of mathematics and computer science meet the next generation." It brings together Laureates in computing (recipients of the Turing Award and the ACM Prize in Computing) and mathematics (Abel Prize, Fields Medal, and the IMU Abacus Medal) with 100 young researchers in computing and 100 in mathematics. These young researchers are undergraduates, graduate students, and early-stage postdocs who represent a diverse group of global talent in the field. The event is a mix of Laureate lectures and discussions as well as social events for the young researchers to meet and talk with the Laureates.

The 11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum will be held **September 22-27, 2024 in Heidelberg, Germany**. To be considered for participation, [young researchers can either apply directly](https://www.application.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/site/index.php?a=cEs3NXRrRDJEelBFSDVsTTVBWkEzVlE5L3hPSzlEZmhwNnplMWJqRVhqd3BNUFRxblluVnZURnVqMzllWEFzVndDUUFWbi9qVXd6NHdaUWYzcU9GZzhBa0FGWi80MU1NK01HVUg5NmpoWU5sblBUVmp6VnAydE9zaEw5bVA3Rkg=) or be nominated by a colleague, professor, mentor, or manager who can attest to the quality of their work. In the selection process, nominated applications may carry a bit more weight than direct applications. If you or a colleague would like to make a nomination for a young researcher in computing, you will need to [register to be a nominator](https://www.application.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/site/index.php?a=OE5vNVEyMGU1WUplUkJGUE51UUVkU0ZiUGVzNmZHWU9oeXowREt4OWJoc3BNUFRxblluVnZURnVqMzllWEFzVndDUUFWbi9qVXd6NHdaUWYzcU9GZzhBa0FGWi80MU1NK01HVUg5NmpoWU5sblBUVmp6VnAydE9zaEw5bVA3Rkg=) using the ACM "Organization code": **ACM59751**. In computing, the pool of applications and nominations will be reviewed by global computing experts from ACM.

Applications must be completed by **February 9, 2024**. Read more about the young researcher HLF experience and how to apply in the [FAQ for Young Researchers](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/young-researchers/faq.html).

Through the Heidelberg Laureate Forum, ACM is helping to raise the visibility of the computing discipline worldwide as well as helping to provide an incomparable learning experience for young researchers. I hope you will share this information about the event with colleagues and students. I also hope your department (or school or laboratory or center) will be the source of several applications or nominations.
