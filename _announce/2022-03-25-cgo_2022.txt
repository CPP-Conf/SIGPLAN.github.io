IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)
co-located with PPoPP, CC, and HPCA
Virtual Conference
April 2 - 6, 2022
https://cgo.org/

** With the continued impact of the COVID-19, the joint steering
committee of CGO/PPoPP/HPCA/CC has decided to hold the 2022 conference
as a virtual (online) event. **

The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)
is a premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners
working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of
optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The
conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic
approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific
architectural features and support for code generation and
optimization.

Registration is open at:
