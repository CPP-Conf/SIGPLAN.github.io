*** Exciting News!

Preparations for AEiC 2024, the 28th Ada-Europe International
Conference on Software Reliable Technologies, are well underway!

Registrations opened Tuesday April 16, and we've got some exciting
offers lined up for you, courtesy of our generous sponsors Rising
STARS and AdaCore, as well as an inspiring program.

See below for an overview, and visit our website for more details about
accepted contributions, registration fees, social events and many more.

*** General Information

The 28th Ada-Europe International Conference on Reliable Software
Technologies (AEiC 2024) will take place in Barcelona, Spain.
The conference schedule comprises a keynote and an invited talk,
a panel with invited experts, a journal track, an industrial track,
a work-in-progress track, a vendor exhibition, parallel tutorials and
hackaton, and satellite workshops.  There will be time for networking
during breaks and lunches, as well as various social events.

AEiC 2024 is the latest in a series of annual international conferences
started in the early 80's, under the auspices of Ada-Europe, the
international organization that promotes knowledge and use of the Ada
programming language and reliable software in general, into academic
education and research, and industrial practice.

The Ada-Europe series of conferences has over the years become
a leading international forum for providers, practitioners and
researchers in reliable software technologies.  These events
highlight the increased relevance of Ada in general and in safety-
and security-critical systems in particular, and provide a unique
opportunity for interaction and collaboration between academics and
industrial practitioners.

The 2024 edition of the conference continues a number of important
innovations started in previous years:
- reduced conference registration fee for all authors;
- low registration fee for all tutorials and workshops;
- journal-based open-access publication model for peer-reviewed papers;
- compact program with two core days (Wednesday & Thursday);
- tutorials on Tuesday, followed by welcome event for all participants;
- workshops on Friday, optional chill event on Thursday evening.

*** Overview of the Week

- Tue 11: six half-day tutorials, full-day hackaton, welcome reception
- Wed 12: core technical program, conference banquet
- Thu 13: core technical program, post conference chill-out

invited talk.  All will address topics of relevance in the conference
scope, with time for questions and answers.

- On Wed June 12, a keynote talk by Francisco J. Cazorla and Jaume
  Abella, from Barcelona Supercomputing Center, who will talk about
  "Strategies to Build Safety Relevant High-Performance HW/SW Platforms
  for Critical Embedded Systems".

- On Thu June 13, a panel on "AI for Safety-Critical Systems: How
  'I' Should the AI be?", moderated by Cristina Seceleanu, Mälardalen
  University, with three invited experts: Kerstin Bach (Norwegian
  University of Science and Technology), Irune Yarza (Ikerlan),
  Marta Barroso (Barcelona Supercomputing Center).

- And an invited talk by Rosa Maria Badia, Barcelona Supercomputing
  Center, on "Simplifying the Life-Cycle Management of Complex
  Application Workflows".

*** Conference Core Composition

The core conference program features three distinct types of technical
presentations, with different duration, in addition to the keynote
talk and the pannel session: journal-track talks (25 minutes),
industrial-track talks (15 minutes), work-in-progress-track talks
(10 minutes).

All papers presented in the journal track, the industrial track and
the work-in-progress track have undergone peer review.  Presentations
are combined into by-theme and not by-track sessions, in order that
authors and participants alike enjoy all flavors of the program in
a mixed as opposed to segregated combination.
