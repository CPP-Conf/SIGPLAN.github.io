Located in downtown Toronto, the largest and most culturally diverse city in Canada and on the  territory of the Anishinaabeg, Haudenosaunee and the Wendat Peoples, the Department of Computer Science in the Faculty of Science at Toronto Metropolitan University invites applications for several tenure track positions at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor, effective July 1, 2023 or January 1, 2024, subject to final budgetary approval. Hiring at the Associate level will normally require already having achieved tenure elsewhere.

The department is in a strong growth phase (over 2000 undergrads and 100+ graduate students). As such, we are currently seeking strong candidates in all areas of computer science, but with particular interest in Cybersecurity, Human-Computer Interaction, Networking, Programming Languages, Robotics, Theory, and Visual Computing.

We are accepting applications for tenure stream positions at the rank of Assistant/Associate Professor in:
    Human-Computer Interaction (at least 1)
    Programming Languages (at least 1)
    Cybersecurity (at least 1)
    All areas of Computer Science (several more)

We are likely hiring over a dozen positions over the next several years. The posting is open now and will remain open for at least the next year, with hiring occurring as qualified people are interviewed. The full posting is available at:
