21st International Conference on Software and Systems Reuse (ICSR 2024)

June 10-12, 2024, 5* St. Raphael Resort and Marina, Limassol, Cyprus

(*** Submission Deadline: February 12, 2024 AoE ***)


The International Conference on Software and Systems Reuse (ICSR) is a biannual conference
in the field of software reuse research and technology. ICSR is a premier event aiming to
present the most recent advances and breakthroughs in the area of software reuse and to 
promote an intensive and continuous exchange among researchers and practitioners.

The guiding theme of this edition is Sustainable Software Reuse.

We invite submissions on new and innovative research results and industrial experience
reports dealing with all aspects of software reuse within the context of the modern software 
development landscape. Topics include but are not limited to the following.

1	Technical aspects of reuse, including
• Reuse in/for Quality Assurance (QA) techniques, testing, verification, etc.
• Domain ontologies and Model-Driven Development
• Variability management and software product lines
• Context-aware and Dynamic Reuse
• Reuse in and for Machine Learning
• Domain-specific languages (DSLs)
• New language abstractions for software reuse
• Generative Development
• COTS-based development and reuse of open source assets
• Retrieval and recommendation of reusable assets
• Reuse of non-code artefacts
• Architecture-centric reuse approaches
• Service-oriented architectures and microservices
• Software composition and modularization
• Sustainability and software reuse
• Economic models of reuse
• Benefit and risk analysis, scoping
• Legal and managerial aspects of reuse
• Reuse adoption and transition to software reuse
• Lightweight reuse approaches
• Reuse in agile projects
• Technical debt and software reuse

2	Software reuse in industry and in emerging domains
• Reuse success stories
• Reuse failures, and lessons learned
• Reuse obstacles and success factors
• Return on Investment (ROI) studies
• Reuse in hot topic domains (Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Virtualization,
Network functions, Quantum Computing, etc.)

We welcome research (16 pages) and industry papers (12 pages) following the Springer
Lecture Notes in Computer Science format. Submissions will be handled via
EasyChair (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icsr2024). Submissions will be
**double-blindly** reviewed, meaning that authors should:
• Omit all authors’ names and affiliations from the title page
• Do not include the acknowledgement section, if you have any, in the submitted paper
• Refer to your own work in the third person
• Use anonymous GitHub, Zenondo, FigShare or equivalent to provide access to artefacts
without disclosing your identity

Both research and industry papers will be reviewed by members of the same program
committee (check the website for details). Proceedings will be published by Springer in
their Lecture Notes for Computer Science (LNCS) series. An award will be given to the best 
research and the best industry papers.

The authors of selected papers from the conference will be invited to submit an extended 
version (containing at least 30% new material) to a special issue in the Journal of Systems and 
Software (Elsevier). More details will follow.
