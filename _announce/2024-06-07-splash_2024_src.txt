The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) offers a unique opportunity 
for undergraduate and graduate students to present their research to a 
panel of judges and conference attendees at SPLASH. The SRC provides 
visibility and exposes up-and-coming researchers to computer science 
research and the research community. This competition also gives students 
an opportunity to discuss their research with experts in their field, get 
feedback, and sharpen their communication and networking skills.


### Eligibility criteria

Participants must have current student status, either graduate or 
undergraduate, at the time of the competition. Participants in the SRC 
must also be current ACM (student) members.


### Prizes

Winners of the three top places in each category receive prizes of $500 
for the first place winner, $300 for the second place winner and $200 
for the third place winner, respectively.


The top three undergraduate and graduate winners receive an award medal 
and a one-year complimentary ACM student membership with a subscription 
to ACM's Digital Library.


### ACM SRC Grand Finals

First place winners in each category will be invited to participate in 
the ACM SRC Grand Finals, an online round of competition between 
first-place SRC winners from different ACM conferences held in 2024. 
Grand Finals will be judged by an ACM-appointed panel of judges. Winners 
of the three top Grand Finals places in each category will receive additional 
prizes of $500 for the first place winner, $300 for the second place winner 
and $200 for the third place winner, respectively. Winners of the SRC Grand 
Finals are recognized at the Annual ACM Awards Banquet along with prestigious 
ACM award winners, including the winner of the Turing Award.
