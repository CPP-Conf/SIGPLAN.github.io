*** Early Call for Contributions ***

9th European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing
(ESOCC 2022)

March 22-24, 2022, Lutherstadt Wittenberg, Germany

https://www.esocc-conf.eu


Scope

Service-oriented and cloud computing have made a huge impact both on the software
industry and on the research community. Today, service and cloud technologies are
applied to build large-scale software landscapes as well as to provide single software
services to end users. Services today are independently developed and deployed as
well as freely composed while they can be implemented in a variety of technologies, a
quite important fact from a business perspective. Similarly, cloud computing aims at
enabling flexibility by offering a centralised sharing of resources. The industry's need
for agile and flexible software and IT systems has made cloud computing the
dominating paradigm for provisioning computational resources in a scalable, on-
demand fashion. Nevertheless, service developers, providers, and integrators still
need to create methods, tools and techniques to support cost-effective and secure
development as well as use of dependable devices, platforms, services and service-
oriented applications in the cloud.

The European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing (ESOCC) is the
premier conference on advances in the state of the art and practice of service-
oriented computing and cloud computing in Europe. The main objectives of this
conference are to facilitate the exchange between researchers and practitioners in the
areas of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, as well as to explore the
new trends in those areas and foster future collaborations in Europe and beyond.


Tracks

- Main conference: three days of invited talks, panels, and presentations of selected
research papers, including a dedicated day to satellite workshops.

- PhD Symposium: an opportunity for PhD students to present their research activities
and perspectives, to critically discuss them with other PhD students and with
established researchers in the area, hence getting fruitful feedback and advices on
their research activities.

- Projects Track: a useful opportunity for researchers to disseminate the latest
research developments in their projects and meet representatives of other consortia.

Details about all the tracks are available at the conference web site:
https://www.esocc-conf.eu .

Submissions

ESOCC 2022 invites submissions in all the tracks:

- Regular research papers (15 pages including references)

- PhD Symposium (8 pages including references, authored by the PhD student with
indication of his/her supervisors' names)

- Projects Track (1 to 5 pages including references, describing an ongoing project)

We only accept original papers, not submitted for publication elsewhere. The papers
must be formatted according to the LNCS proceedings guidelines. They must be
submitted to the EasyChair site at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esocc2022 by selecting the right track.

All accepted regular research papers are expected to be published in the main
conference proceedings by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series (http://www.springer.com/lncs).

Accepted papers of the other tracks and the satellite workshops are expected to be published by Springer in the Communications in Computer and Information Science
(CCIS) series (https://www.springer.com/series/7899).

At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the
work at the conference.

A journal special issue is planned, and authors of selected accepted papers will be
invited to submit extended versions of their articles.


Workshop Proposals

ESOCC 2022 also invites proposals for satellite workshops. More details about the
proposal format and submission can be found at https://esocc-conf.eu/index.php/workshops/ .
