The ACM History Committee’s 2022 fellowship competition is for research projects on or centrally-related to ACM history. The History Committee plans to support up to four projects with awards up to $4,000.  The History Committee has awarded over 40 fellowships since the start of this fellowship program in 2009.   Many of these awards have gone to scholars (graduate students to senior scholars) in the SIGs to support preservation of ACM SIGs’ history.
