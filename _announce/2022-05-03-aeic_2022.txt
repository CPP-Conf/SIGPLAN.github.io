*** General Information

The 26th Ada-Europe International Conference on Reliable Software
Technologies (AEiC 2022) returns to Belgium, after 2001 in Leuven,
to take place in Ghent, in the week of 14-17 June, in dual mode,
with a solid core of in-presence activities accompanied by digital
support for remote participation.

The conference program includes two core days with keynote
talks, peer-reviewed academic papers, industrial presentations,
work-in-progress presentations and posters, and vendor presentations.
The conference program is bracketed by one day of tutorials, and one
day with three satellite events.  There will be time for networking
during breaks as well as various social events around historic,
cultural, scenic, culinary, and beer brewing highlights of Ghent.

AEiC 2022 is the latest in a series of annual international conferences
started in the early 80's, under the auspices of Ada-Europe, the
international organization that promotes knowledge and use of Ada and
Reliable Software in general, into academic education and research,
and industrial practice.

The Ada-Europe series of conferences has over the years become
a leading international forum for providers, practitioners and
researchers in reliable software technologies.  These events
highlight the increased relevance of Ada in general and in safety-
and security-critical systems in particular, and provide a unique
opportunity for interaction and collaboration between academics and
industrial practitioners.

The 2022 edition of the conference continues a number of important
innovations started at the last in-person conference in 2019:
- lower registration fee for conference, unified for all participants;
- further reduced fee for all authors;
- lower registration fee for all tutorials;
- journal-based open-access publication model for peer-reviewed papers;
- more compact program with two core days (Wednesday & Thursday);
- tutorials on Tuesday, followed by welcome event for all participants;
- several satellite events on Friday.

*** Overview of the Week

- Tue 14: four half-day tutorials, welcome reception
- Wed 15 & Thu 16: core program, social events on each day
- Fri 17: two full-day workshops and Birds-of-a-Feather meeting

Extensive information on AEiC 2022 is on the conference web site,
such as an overview of the program, the list of accepted papers and
presentations, and descriptions of workshops, tutorials, keynote
presentations, and social events.  Also check the conference site
for registration, accommodation and travel information.  The Advance
Program brochure is available there as well.

*** Venue

The conference will take place in the heart of the city of Ghent,
Belgium, capital of the East Flanders province, a half-hour train ride
north-west of Brussels and the international airport.  Ghent is rich
in history, culture and higher-education, with a top-100 university
founded in 1817.

*** Invited Speakers

On each of the two main conference days, an invited talk will be
delivered to address topics of relevance in the conference scope,
with time for questions and answers.

- On Thu June 16, a keynote talk by Cristina (Crista) Lopes, School
  of Computer Sciences, University of California at Irvine, USA,
  who will present her study on "The Curious Case of Code Duplication
  in Github".

- On Wed Jun 15, a spotlight talk (remote) by Anita Carleton,
  Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA,
  about "Envisioning the Future of Software Engineering".

*** Conference Core Composition

The core conference program features five distinct types of
technical presentations, with different duration, all followed by
discussion time: keynote and spotlight talks, journal-track talks,
industrial-track talks, short work-in-progress-track talks, vendor
talks.

All papers presented in the journal track, the industrial track and
the work-in-progress track have undergone peer review.  Presentations
