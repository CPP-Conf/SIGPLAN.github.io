maintenance and evolution topics (in alphabetical order):

• Change and defect management
• Code cloning and provenance
• Concept and feature location
• Continuous integration/deployment
• Empirical studies of software maintenance and evolution
• Evolution of non-code artifacts
• Human aspects of software maintenance and evolution
• Maintenance and evolution of model-based methods
• Maintenance and evolution processes
• Maintenance and evolution of mobile apps
• Maintenance and evolution of service-oriented and cloud computing systems
• Maintenance versus release process
• Mining software repositories
• Productivity of software engineers during maintenance and evolution
• Release engineering
• Reverse engineering and re-engineering
• Run-time evolution and dynamic configuration
• Software and system comprehension
• Software migration and renovation
• Software quality assessment
• Software refactoring and restructuring
• Software testing theory and practice
• Source code analysis and manipulation
• Technical Debt

ICSME welcomes innovative ideas that are timely, well presented, and evaluated. All
submissions must position themselves within the existing literature, describe the
relevance of the results to specific software engineering goals, and include a clear
motivation and presentation of the work.

ICSME invites contributions to a number of different tracks. These are listed below
