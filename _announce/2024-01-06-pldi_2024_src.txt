timestamp: "1/6/2024 19:16:20"
deadline: "3/22/2024"

[The Student Research Competition (SRC) at PLDI](https://pldi24.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2024-src) allows students to present their
research and get feedback from prominent members of the programming language
research community. It’s an opportunity for students to network, practice
presentation skills, and showcase their work. PLDI invites students (both at the
graduate and undergraduate level) to submit their research. If you are an
undergraduate student interested in applying to graduate programs, we highly
encourage you to participate and get a glimpse of what academic life looks like!

# Eligibility Criteria

Participants must have current student status, either graduate or undergraduate,
at the time of the submission deadline. Participants in the SRC must also apply
and obtain an ACM student membership. There are two separate categories:

- **Undergraduate**: Currently enrolled for a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent)
- **Graduate**: Currently enrolled for either a master’s or PhD degree (or
  equivalent) If have any questions on if your work is a good fit for the SRC
  track, please reach out to the SRC Co-Chairs.

# Call for Papers
The main body of the submission is a title and extended abstract consisting of
the following:

- **Problem and Motivation**: Clearly state the problem being addressed and
  explain the reasons for seeking a solution to this problem.
- **Background and Related Work**: Describe the specialized (but pertinent)
  background necessary to appreciate the work in the context of PLDI areas of
  interest. Include references to the literature where appropriate, and briefly
  explain where your work departs from that done by others.
- **Approach and Uniqueness**: Describe your approach in addressing the problem
  and clearly state how your approach is novel.
- **Results and Contributions**: Clearly show how the results of your work
  contribute to programming language design and implementation in particular and
  to computer science in general; explain the significance of those results.

Submissions must be original research that is not already published at PLDI or
another conference or journal. One of the goals of the SRC is to give students
feedback on ongoing, unpublished work. Furthermore, the abstract must be
authored solely by the student. If the work is collaborative with others and/or
part of a larger group project, the abstract should make clear what the
student’s role was and should focus on that portion of the work.

# Participation
The SRC has three rounds:

- **Paper round**: Student papers are accepted by a committee of reviewers
- **Poster round**: During the conference, students present a poster to
  in-person judges and conference attendees.
- **Presentation round**: In-person judges select students from the poster round
  who then give a final talk.
- **Results**: Three students from each category (graduate and undergraduate)
  are selected as winners. The top student in each category is invited to
  participate in the ACM grand finale.
- **Prizes**: Winners receive a cash prize: $500, $300, and $200 for the first,
  second, and third place respectively as well as an award medal.

# Submissions
The submission form will require the following:

- The submissions are double blind (the uploaded PDFs should not have your name
  or any other identifying information).
- In the supplementary form, please specify:
  - Student author’s name, email address, institutional affiliation, and
    category (undergraduate or graduate)
  - Student’s ACM member number. If you don’t already have one, please apply for
    the discounted student member rate.
  - Research advisor’s name(s)
  - Mode of presentation (in-person or virtual). Please be conservative in your
    response: if you think there is a possibility that you might not be able to
    attend in-person, select the “virtual” option. We are able to accommodate
    transition to in-person more easily than to virtual.
  
For the paper submission, ensure:

- Use the `acmart` template file ([overleaf
  template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yggzbgjwjntv), [latex
  template](https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/asplos24-templates.zip)).
  - Set the options to the class file using
    `\documentclass[sigconf,nonacm,screen,review]{acmart}`
- No more than 2 pages. Reference lists do not count towards these limits.

When you’re ready, submit your extended abstract at the submission site: **TBA**.
