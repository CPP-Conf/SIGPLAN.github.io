Call for Papers: Special Issue on "Probabilistic Programming" of

 ACM Transactions on Probabilistic Machine Learning (ACM-TOPML)

Probabilistic programming is a very active research area that brings together diverse fields, such as statistics, machine learning and AI, applications, programming languages, and formal verification. The aim of this special issue is to present new approaches, techniques, tools, theories and experience reports about adopting, creating, applying and improving probabilistic programming.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Applications of probabilistic programming
Approximate inference algorithms for probabilistic programs
Automatic differentiation for probabilistic programs
Automated program analysis for probabilistic programs
Deep probabilistic programming languages
Design and implementation of probabilistic programming languages
Differentiable programming
Exact inference algorithms for probabilistic programs
Model learning and checking for probabilistic programs
Statistical theory on inference schemes
Semantics for probabilistic programming
Synthesis and learning of probabilistic programs
Theoretical analysis of probabilistic programs
Types for probabilistic programming and differentiable programming
Verification and testing probabilistic programming paradigms
