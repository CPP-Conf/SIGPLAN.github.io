Programming languages are everywhere in interactive entertainment, often hiding in plain sight â€“ from high-level tools for creating games and generative art, to scripting languages for non-player characters, to level and artifact representation formats, to compilers from high-level designer specifications to runnable code, to game engines driven by language-like rules.

The PLIE workshop at AIIDE 2021 (https://sites.google.com/view/aiide2021/) aims to bring researchers and practitioners together who work at the intersection of Programming Languages (PL) and Interactive Entertainment, both broadly construed; especially PL methods applied in game- and art-related contexts. The goal is to bring together researchers across communities, i.e. who participate primarily in one of these communities but have an interest in both areas, to identify convergent lines of work and spark new collaborations.

PLIE welcomes papers in several formats, including 2-page "conversation starters", abstracts for demos and tutorials, and research papers up to 10 pages. For more information, see our online CFP: https://sites.google.com/view/plie21/call-for-participation?authuser=0

Paper Deadline:	August 12
