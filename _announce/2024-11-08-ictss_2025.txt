37th International Conference on Testing Software and Systems (ICTSS 2025)

September 17-19, 2025, 5* St. Raphael Resort and Marina, Limassol, Cyprus

https://conf.researchr.org/home/ictss-2025

(*** Proceedings to be published by Springer in LNCS ***)


IFIP-ICTSS is a well-established conference where researchers, developers, testers, and users
from industry get together to present and discuss the most recent innovations, experiences
and open challenges related to testing software and systems and measuring software quality. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

■ Aspects of testing: test derivation, test selection, test generation, test coverage, test
concretization, test implementation and execution, test result analysis, test oracle, verdict
computation, test management, active testing and passive testing, monitoring and runtime
verification.

■ Testing new technologies: this year we encourage submissions focused on testing Large
Language Models (LLMs), audit machine learning systems (especially for applications to Health) 
and Quantum systems (programs, computers, and simulators).

■ Diversity on testing: diverse generation, selecting diverse test suites, foundations of testing 
and diversity, applications of entropy and Kolmogorov complexity on test suite diversity.

■ Theoretical approaches: formalisms (such as automata, state machines, process algebra, 
logics, Markov-chains…), testing frameworks, results for compositionality, refinement, 
soundness and completeness, addressing complex systems, heterogeneous or hybrid systems.

■ Modelling languages (such as UML, MATLAB, Simulink, Modelica…) and associated
tooling for model-based testing: test generation from models, model-based oracles. 
Scalability, traceability, quantification issues. Automated support of any parts of the testing 
activities, testing processes, test-driven development, sound metrics and measurements.

■ Testing of quality aspects: Functional, interoperability, unit, integration, performance, load, 
conformance, non-regression, reliability, robustness.

■ Security Testing: methodologies and techniques for continuous security assessment, security
monitoring, security review, penetration testing, verification of certification compliance; 
automation of security testing processes.

■ Cross domains and combination of techniques: using other techniques such as proof,
model-checking, symbolic execution, abstract interpretation, static analysis, simulation, model 
learning, machine learning, expert systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms… to improve 
quality and reduce the effort in testing processes.

■ Application aspects and case studies: Communicating systems such as cyberphysical 
systems, systems of systems, embedded systems, web services systems, smart grids, cloud 
computing systems, business information systems, real-time systems, distributed and
concurrent systems. Case studies and industrial applications involving qualified empirical 
evaluations.


IFIP-ICTSS Invites:

Full papers (12 to 15 pages plus at most 2 extra pages for references in the one-column 
Springer LNCS format) describing original research contributions with sufficient evidence for
the interest of the proposed approach.

Industry papers (12 to 15 pages plus at most 2 extra pages for references in the one-column
Springer LNCS format) describing original research or experience report conducted within an
industrial environment or in collaboration with an industry partner.

Short papers or work-in-progress papers (up to 6 pages plus at most 1 extra page for
references in the one-column Springer LNCS format) describing academic work in progress or 
tool implementations, as well as testing processes, achievements and feedback on testing 
methods for industrial case studies.

Journal-First. The aim of the Journal-First (JF) submission category is to further enrich the
program of ICTSS, as well as to provide an overall more flexible path to publication and 
dissemination of original research that is within the scope of ICTSS. A submission in this 
category must adhere to the following criteria:
■ It should be clearly within the scope of the conference.
■ It should be recent: it should have been accepted and made publicly available in a journal 
(online or in print) by January 1, 2023 or more recently.
■ It has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, Journal- First tracks of other
conferences or workshops.
■ The submission has to be in the form of a 4-page extended abstract and has to provide a
concise summary of the published journal paper.
■ It must be marked as such in the submission’s, and must explicitly include full bibliographic
details (including a DOI) of the journal publication they are based on. Since the referenced 
journal papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the corresponding journals, 
submissions in the JF category will not be reviewed again for technical content. Submissions will
be judged on the basis of the above criteria, but also considering how well they would 
complement the conference’s technical program. Accepted submissions in this category will be
part of the proceedings of ICTSS 2025, with the title equal to the original title of the article with
the prefix.

The submission link is: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ictss2025

The papers will be published by Springer in the LNCS volume.

Authors should consult Springer’s Instructions for Authors of Proceedings
(https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)
and use either the LaTeX or the Word templates provided on the authors’ page. Springer’s 
proceedings LaTeX templates are available in Overleaf.

Authors are encouraged to include their ORCIDs in their papers.


Journal Special Issue

Best papers of the conference will be invited to submit an extended version of their article at a
special (topical) issue of the Springer Nature of Computer Science
(https://link.springer.com/journal/42979). Deadline will be near the end of December 2025
with a tentative publication date for the middle 2026.


Collocation

ICTSS 2025 will be collocated with the 19th European Conference on Software Architecture
(https://conf.researchr.org/home/ecsa-2025).
