		*** FUNARCH 2023 -- CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***

		      The First ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
	     Functional Software Architecture - FP in the Large

		8th September 2023, Seattle, Washington, USA
			  Co-located with ICFP 2023

	 https://www.functional-architecture.org/events/funarch-2023/

    ======================================================================

    BACKGROUND:

    The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Functional Software Architecture - FP
    in the Large aims to disseminate and enable the use of functional
    programming in the large and long-lived software projects.

    We specifically want:

    - To assemble a community interested in software architecture
      techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;

    - To identify, categorize, and document topics relevant to
      the field of functional software architecture;

    - To connect the functional programming community to the software
      architecture community to cross-pollinate between the two.

    We'd love for you to be part of this effort.  Whatever your
    background, you're welcome at FUNARCH - to listen to talks, report
    on your experience, and interact with others that share our goals.

    See you at FUNARCH!

    REGISTRATION:

    You can register for the workshop via the registration page for
    the ICFP conference, but there's no need to also register for
    the conference.  Reduced fees are available until 5th August.
