The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA)
is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing 
together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new 
ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems. 
 
ECOOP is Europe’s longest-standing annual Programming Languages conference, 
bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students to share their ideas and 
experiences in all topics related to programming languages, software development, 
object-oriented technologies, systems and applications. ECOOP welcomes high 
quality research papers relating to these fields in a broad sense.
 
Registration
================
 
Registration to ECOOP 2021 and ISSTA 2021 is still open - and free of charge!
 
If you haven't registered yet, there are still a few days left to do so. The registration is

Programs
================
 
The ISSTA 2021 program [2] and the ECOOP 2021 program [3] are up online.
 
ISSTA is celebrating its 30th edition and ECOOP, its 35th. 
To mark the occasion, we have invited 18 experts to chair nine “Discussion with Experts” 
sessions, each 40-minutes long. In addition, ISSTA will hold two panels on the past and 
future of software testing and analysis at ISSTA, featuring senior members of the 
community. 
 
Tune in for a busy week with 51 ISSTA papers, 24 ECOOP papers, a joint poster session, 
summer school, tool demos, and seven workshops.
 
Presentations will be given twice across three timebands to accommodate the international 
audience. This model ensures that anyone across the world can watch each talk at a 
reasonable time.
 
During the week, ECOOP will present multiple awards:
- The AITO Dahl-Nygaard Senior prize to Kim Bruce
- The AITO Dahl-Nygaard Junior prize to Karim Ali
- The AITO Test of Time award 2021 to Gregor Kiczales, Erik Hilsdale, Jim Hugunin, Mik 
   Kersten, Jeffrey Palm, William G. Griswold, for their work published at ECOOP'01: 
   "An Overview of AspectJ"
- Two distinguished paper awards to:
  - “Lossless, Persisted Summarization of Static Callgraph, Points-To and Data-Flow Analysis” 
     by Philipp Schubert, Ben Hermann, and Eric Bodden.
  - “Multiparty Languages: the Choreographic and Multitier Cases” by Saverio Giallorenzo, 
     Fabrizio Montesi, Marco Peressotti, David Richter, Guido Salvaneschi and, Pascal 
     Weisenburger.
 
ISSTA will also present:
- The ISSTA Impact Paper award to "Automated Debugging: Past, Present, and Future" 
   from Alessandro Orso and Chris Parnin.
- Four distinguished paper awards:
  - “Type and Interval aware Array Constraint Solving for Symbolic Execution”, by Ziqi Shuai, 
     Zhenbang Chen, Yufeng Zhang, Jun Sun, and Ji Wang.
  - “A Lightweight Framework for Function Name Reassignment Based on Large-Scale Stripped 
     Binaries”, by Han Gao, Shaoyin Cheng, Yinxing Xue, and Weiming Zhang.
  - “SAND: A Static Analysis Approach for Detecting SQL Antipatterns”, by Yingjun Lyu, 
     Sasha Volokh, William G.J. Halfond, and Omer Tripp.
  - “Test-Case Prioritization for Configuration Testing”, by Runxiang Cheng, Lingming Zhang, 
     Darko Marinov, and Tianyin Xu.
 
This year, ISSTA and ECOOP are co-located with REBASE and SPIN, giving all communities the 
chance to interact and exchange ideas at the intersection of testing, analysis, and programming 
languages.
 
Looking forward to meeting you online!
