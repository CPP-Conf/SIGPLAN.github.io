*Call for Papers*
====================
2022 ACM Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)
Mon 20 - Fri 24 June 2022
San Diego, California, United States
https://pldi22.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2022-pldi#Call-for-Papers

PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance. PLDI seeks outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all welcome emphases in strong PLDI submissions.

Reviewers will evaluate each contribution for its accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as to experts on the paperâ€™s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work.

Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing their submissions. (http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/EmpiricalEvaluation/)
