The 38th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2022)
        https://software.imdea.org/Conferences/ICLP2022/

                        Haifa, Israel
                      August 2-8, 2022

  ICLP 2022 will be a physical event in Haifa, Israel
  Part of the FLOC 2022

=========================================================================

Scope
*****

Since the first conference held in Marseille in 1982, ICLP has been
the premier international event for presenting research in logic
programming.  Contributions are sought in all areas of logic
programming, including but not restricted to:

** Foundations:Semantics, Formalisms, Nonmonotonic reasoning,
   Knowledge representation.

** Languages issues: Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility,
   Higher order, Types, Modes, Assertions, Modules, Meta-programming,
   Logic-based domain-specific languages, Programming techniques.

** Programming support: Program analysis, Transformation, Validation,
   Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Testing, Execution
   visualization.

** Implementation: Compilation, Virtual machines, Memory management,
   Parallel/distributed execution, Constraint handling rules, Tabling,
   Foreign interfaces, User interfaces.

** Related Paradigms and Synergies: Inductive and coinductive logic
   programming, Constraint logic programming, Answer set programming,
   Interaction with SAT, SMT and CSP solvers, Theorem proving,
   Argumentation, Probabilistic programming, Machine learning.

** Applications: Databases, Big data, Data integration and federation,
   Software engineering, Natural language processing, Web and semantic
   web, Agents, Artificial intelligence, Computational life sciences,
   Cybersecurity, Robotics, Education.

Tracks and Special Sessions
***************************

Besides the main track, ICLP 2022 will host additional tracks:

** Applications Track: this track invites submissions of papers on
   emerging and deployed applications of LP, describing all aspects of
   the development, deployment, and evaluation of logic programming
   systems to solve real-world problems, including interesting case
   studies and benchmarks, and discussing lessons learned.

** Recently Published Research Track: this track provides a forum to
   discuss important results related to logic programming that
   appeared recently (from January 2020 onwards) in selective journals
   and conferences, but have not been previously presented at ICLP.

In addition,  ICLP 2022 will house:

** Doctoral Consortium and Mentoring Sessions: the Doctoral Consortium
   (DC) on Logic Programming provides students and early career
   researchers with the opportunity to present and discuss their
   research directions, obtain feedback from both peers and experts in
   the field, and participate in mentoring sessions on how to prepare
   and succeed for a research career. We will have leaders in logic
   programming research from academia and industry to give invited
   talks on their research areas. The best paper from the DC will be
   given the opportunity to make a presentation in a session of the
   main ICLP conference.

** Tutorials and Co-located Workshops.

** Revision submission (TPLP papers): April 1, 2022
** Final notifications (all paper kinds): April 30, 2022

Submission Details
******************

We note that papers accepted at ICLP may appear either in 
    * Theory and Practice of Logic Programming Journal (TPLP), or
    * Technical Communication Proceeding (TC) published by 
        Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)

TPLP format is described at
   https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/information/instructions-contributors

EPTCS format is described at
   http://style.eptcs.org/

All accepted papers will be presented during the conference. Authors 
of accepted papers will, by default, be automatically included in the 
list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from 
the Logic Programming Newsletter at no cost. 

All submissions must be written in English.

Expected submissions: 

* For Main Track and Application Track:

   All papers must describe original, previously unpublished research,
   and must not simultaneously be submitted for publication
   elsewhere. These restrictions do not apply to previously accepted
   workshop papers with a limited audience and/or without archival
   proceedings.

** Regular papers (14 pages in TPLP format, including references) The
   accepted regular papers will be published in TPLP. The program
   committee may recommend some regular papers to be published in
   Technical Communication Proceeding (TC). In this case, the papers
   will have to be reformatted into EPTCS format and not exceed 14
   pages. Authors who submitted Regular papers that were accepted as
   TC may elect to convert their submissions into extended abstracts
   (2 or 3 pages in EPTCS format). This should allow authors to
   submit a long version elsewhere.

** Short papers (7 pages in EPTCS format, including references). The
   accepted short papers will be published in the Technical
   Communication Proceedings.


* Recently Published Research Track

** Extended abstract (2 or 3 pages in EPTCS format) describing
   previously published research (from January 2020 onwards) in
   selective journals and conferences, but that have not been
   previously presented at ICLP.  A title page should be appended to
   the submission with (i) details on the venue, where the original
   paper appeared, (ii) a link to the original paper, (iii) a
   paragraph describing why the authors believe this work warrants a
   presentation at ICLP. The extended abstracts will be published in
   the Technical Communication Proceedings.


Submissions will be done via EasyChair. The submission Web page for
ICLP2022 is https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iclp2022
