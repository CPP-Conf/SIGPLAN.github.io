*** Call for Workshops and Minisymposia ***

29th International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing
(Euro-Par 2023)

August 28 - September 1, 2023, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://2023.euro-par.org


SCOPE

Euro-Par is the prime European conference covering all aspects of parallel and
distributed processing, ranging from theory to practice, from small to the largest
parallel and distributed systems and infrastructures, from fundamental
computational problems to applications, from architecture, compiler, language and
interface design and implementation, to tools, support infrastructures, and
application performance aspects. To provide a meeting point for researchers to
discuss and exchange new ideas and hot topics related to parallel and distributed 
computing and their applications, Euro-Par 2023 will co-locate workshops and, for
the first time, minisymposia with the main conference. This is an invitation to send
proposals for the workshop and, for the first time, a minisymposium program. Both
workshops and minisymposia will be held on August 28 - August 29, 2023, the first
two days of the conference.


WORKSHOPS

Workshop Proposal Guidelines

The proposals should include the following information:
- Workshop title and acronym, preference for length (half or full-day)
- Information of the organizers, including a short biography of each organizer
(5-10 lines). Each workshop will have a single main organizer, the corresponding
contact. Others can be co-organizers. All the organizers must be a staff member
at an institution or a company, and no PhD or other students can be organizers.
- A tentative program committee (10-15 members)
- Motivation of the workshop:
* scientific objective
* interest to the Euro-Par community
* positioning with respect to the currently existing Euro-Par workshops
- Description of the workshop:
* content
* format (contributed papers, invited talks, panels, posters or any other kind of 
activity including european project meetings)
* organizational aspects
- Workshop background (number of previous editions jointly with Europar or in any 
other format)
- Link to international projects/initiatives

The decision about the acceptance/rejection of a workshop proposal will be made
on the basis of the overall quality of the proposal and the degree to which it matches
the scope of the conference. In the case that several workshop proposals have very
similar objectives and scopes, a merge of overlapping workshops may be 
recommended. The topics covered by a workshop should not overlap with the main 
topics of the conference. Decisions will be made on a rolling basis. Proposals can 
already be sent, and the organizers may be notified before the notification deadline
in case of a strong proposal.

Workshop Organizer Responsibilities

- Preparing the call for papers for the workshop and publicizing it
- Preparing and maintaining the workshop Web site including the relevant sections
according to the organization guidelines
- Selecting the workshop program committee considering that each member of the
committee should make at least one review
- Selecting papers through a rigorous peer-review process including at least three 
reviews per submission using the provided EasyChair installation and considering
the possible conflicts of interest
- Delivering the final workshop program to the Euro-Par 2020 conference co-chairs
in time
- Delivering the preliminary workshop proceedings in time before the conference
- Providing the Euro-Par Steering Committee with a Management Report, after the
conference, with key indicators such as: number of submitted and accepted papers,
program committee and review process management
- Delivering the final workshop proceedings with a revised version of the papers in 
time after the conference in the required Springer LNCS format (12 pages max.) and 
writing a preface to the workshop. Camera-ready papers will be published only if the
management report has been delivered
- Short papers can be accepted and presented at the workshop. However, to be
included in the formal Springer proceedings, the minimum length is of 10 pages per 
paper
- Registering for the conference
- Meet the deadlines according to the organization guidelines

Workshop Proceedings and Paper Review

The workshop proceedings will be published in a separate LNCS workshop volume
after the conference. The principal coordinator of each workshop will appear as
co-editor of the workshop volume. Registered workshop participants will receive
an electronic copy of the volume by email. All authors of accepted papers will be 
requested to sign a Springer copyright form.

The Euro-Par organizers will provide an EasyChair setup for all Euro-Par 2020 
workshops, and its use is mandatory to facilitate paper submissions, reviewing, and
collecting the camera-ready versions. The workshop papers will not be published in
the proceedings otherwise. Each workshop will be an independent track within the 
Workshops' EasyChair installation, but it will be fully manageable by the respective 
organizers. Papers of less than 10 pages will be considered as short papers that can
be presented at the conference but not published in the proceedings.

(Submission address and deadline at the end)


MINISYMPOSIA

A minisymposium is a session of coordinated presentations for promoting
interdisciplinary communication on a topic of current interest and importance in
the field of parallel and distributed computing, ideally having potential application
in other domains. The length and program will be decided by the organizers;
half-day (three-hour) minisymposia are very welcome, longer is possible, not 
exceeding one day (6 hours). The contributions to the minisymposia will not be 
published in the proceedings.

Minisymposium Proposal Guidelines

The proposals should include the following information:
- Minisymposium title and acronym, preference for length (half or full-day)
- Information of the organizers (full name, affiliation, country and email address), 
including a short biography of each organizer (5-10 lines). Each minisymposium
will have a single main organizer, the corresponding contact. Others can be
co-organizers.
- Motivation and scope of the minisymposium:
* Problem area to be addressed by the speakers and possible applications
[max 1500 characters];
* Description of target audience and estimated number of participants
[max 1500 characters]
* Link to international projects/initiatives
- Format (contributed papers, invited talks, panels, posters or any other kind of 
activity including European project meetings),
- Speakers: 
* a tentative list of speakers detailing their names, affiliation, email address and title
of their presentations. Nominated speakers should be approached in advance and

* companies and/or institutions involved

Minisymposium Selection Process

All the submitted proposals will be assessed by the organizing committee. The 
decision about the acceptance/rejection of a minisymposium proposal will be made
on the basis of the overall quality of the proposal and the degree to which it matches 
the scope of the conference. Overlapping minisymposia will be avoided (or possibly 
merged). Decisions will be made on a rolling basis. Proposals can already be sent,
and the organizers may be notified before the notification deadline.

Minisymposium Organizer Responsibilities

Minisymposium organizers will be in charge of making publicity of the 
minisymposium and specify the number of talks and other activities. The 
contributions will be sent to the same web page as the contributions for the 
workshops. The review process will be decided by the minisymposium organizers.
One of the organizers will be the contact with the conference organization. 
- Preparing the call for papers for the workshop and publicizing it
- Preparing and maintaining the minisymposium website mentioning the Euro-Par 
vinculation.
- Deciding the length of the minisymposium, the program and type of activities and 
the names of the speakers. 
- Use the provided EasyChair installation for receiving the contributions 
- Delivering the program to the Euro-Par 2023 conference co-chairs in time
- Providing the Euro-Par Steering Committee with a Management Report, after the

- Registering for the conference as well as all the participants to the minisymposium. 
- Meet the deadlines according to the organization guidelines

Minisymposium publication 

The contributions to the minisymposia will not be published in the proceedings. 
However, the organizers are invited to send one non-compulsory 4-page summary
of the minisymposium. The document should summarize the scientific discussion 
promoted by the minisymposium and it will be published in the same LNCS volume
as the workshop proceedings after the conference. The authors of the summary will 
be requested to sign a Springer copyright form.
