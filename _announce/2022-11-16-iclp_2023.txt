=========================================================================
                         FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
=========================================================================


The 39th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2023)
        https://iclp2023.imperial.ac.uk/

                             London, UK
                           July 9-15, 2023

ICLP 2023 will be an in-person event in London, UK.

=========================================================================

Scope
*****

Since the first conference held in Marseille in 1982, ICLP has been
the premier international event for presenting research in logic
programming. Contributions are sought in all areas of logic
programming, including but not restricted to:

** Theoretical Foundations.
** Language Design and Programming Methodologies.
** Program Analysis and Optimization.
** Implementation Methodologies.
** Related Paradigms, Integration, and Synergies.
** Applications of Logic Programming.

Tracks and Special Sessions
***************************
Besides the main track, ICLP 2023 will host additional tracks:

** Applications Track:
   we invite submissions of papers on emerging and deployed
   applications of LP, describing all aspects of the development,
   deployment, and evaluation of logic programming systems to solve
   real-world problems, including interesting case studies and
   benchmarks, and discussing lessons learned.

** Thematic Tracks:
   we invite submissions to two thematic tracks, exploring specific
   roles and potential for logic programming; these thematic tracks
   are:
   - Logic Programming and Machine Learning
   - Logic Programming and Explainability, Ethics, and Trustworthiness

** Recently Published Research Track:
   this track provides a forum to discuss important results related to
   logic programming that appeared recently (from January 2021
   onwards) in selective journals and conferences, but have not been
   previously presented at ICLP.

** System Demonstrations:
   we invite submissions showcasing logic programming systems and
   implementations in a live setting. This track is not designed to be
   sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see
   the relevance, potential, and innovation of the tool and allow time
   for discussion with its creator.

** Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions:
   we invite proposals for sessions meant to provide an inclusive
   environment for colleagues with similar interests to meet for
   informal discussion. Proposers of BoF sessions should serve as
   discussion leaders only. BoFs are not intended to be presentations.

In addition,  ICLP 2023 will host:

** Doctoral Consortium and Mentoring Sessions:
   the Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming provides students
and early career researchers with the opportunity to present and
discuss their research directions, obtain feedback from both peers and
experts in the field, and participate in mentoring sessions on how to
prepare and succeed for a research career. We will have leaders in
logic programming research from academia and industry to give invited
talks on their research areas. The best paper from the DC will be
given the opportunity to make a presentation in a session of the main
ICLP conference.

** Tutorials.
** Co-located Workshops.
** Summer School on Logic Programming.
** Logic Programming Contest.

Submission Details
******************
All submissions must be written in English.

We note that papers accepted at ICLP may appear either in
    * Theory and Practice of Logic Programming Journal (TPLP), or
    * Technical Communication Proceeding (TC) published by
      Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)

TPLP format is described at
    https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/information/instructions-contributors

EPTCS format is described at
   http://style.eptcs.org/

All accepted papers will be presented during the conference. Authors
of accepted papers will, by default, be automatically included in the
list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic
Programming Newsletter at no cost.

Expected submissions:

* For Main Track, Application Track, and Thematic Tracks:

  All papers must describe original, previously unpublished research,
  and must not simultaneously be submitted for publication elsewhere.
  These restrictions do not apply to previously accepted workshop papers
  with a limited audience and/or without archival proceedings.

** Regular papers (14 pages in TPLP format, including references)
   The accepted regular papers will be published in TPLP. The program
   committee may recommend some regular papers to be published in
   Technical Communication Proceeding (TC). In this case, the papers
   will have to be reformatted into EPTCS format and not exceed 14
   pages. Authors who submitted Regular papers that were accepted as
   TC may elect to convert their submissions into extended abstracts
   (2 or 3 pages in EPTCS format). This should allow authors to submit
   a long version elsewhere.
   
** Short papers (7 pages in EPTCS format, including references).
   The accepted short papers will be published in the Technical
   Communication Proceedings.
   
*  Recently Published Research Track

** Extended abstract (2 or 3 pages in EPTCS format) describing
   previously published research (from January 2021 onwards) in
   selective journals and conferences, but that have not been
   previously presented at ICLP. A title page should be appended to
   the submission with (i) details on the venue, where the original
   paper appeared, (ii) a link to the original paper, (iii) a
   paragraph describing why the authors believe this work warrants a
   presentation at ICLP. The extended abstracts will be published in
   the Technical Communication Proceedings.
   
*  System Demonstrations and BoF Proposals

** Extended abstract (2 or 3 pages in EPTCS format).
   System demonstrations should provide highlights of the novel
   features of the system, along with information about how to access
   it. BoF proposals should motivate the choice of the topic and its
   relevance to logic programming, describe the expected audience,
   identify discussion leaders and their expertise, and provide a
   brief description of the activities during the BoF session. We
   expect BoFs to be inclusive and involve active participation for
   attendees. Describe how your BoF will use inclusive practices and
   foster attendee involvement. The extended abstracts will be
   published in the Technical Communication Proceedings.

   
Submissions will be done via EasyChair.
