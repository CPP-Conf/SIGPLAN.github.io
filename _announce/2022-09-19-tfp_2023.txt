The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions.

This year, TFP will take place in-person at UMass Boston,
Massachusetts in the United States.  It is co-located with the Trends
in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will
take on the day before the main symposium.

Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first,
November 23, is for authors that wish to have their full paper
reviewed prior to the symposium. Papers that are accepted in this way
must also be presented at the symposium. The second, December 16, is
for authors that wish to present their work or work-in progress at the
symposium first without submitting to the full review process for
publication. These authors can then take into account
feedback received at the symposium and submit a full article for
review by the third deadline, February 17.

## Scope

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various
routes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore
identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles
are solicited in any of these categories:

* Research Articles:
  Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
* Position Articles:
  On what new trends should or should not be
* Project Articles:
  Descriptions of recently started new projects
* Evaluation Articles:
  What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
* Overview Articles:
  Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or
experience-oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques
to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

* Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
* Functional programming in the cloud
* High performance functional computing
* Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
* Dependently typed functional programming
* Validation and verification of functional programs
* Debugging and profiling for functional languages
* Functional programming in different application areas:
  security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
  systems, global computing, grids, etc.
* Interoperability with imperative programming languages
* Novel memory management techniques
* Program analysis and transformation techniques
* Empirical performance studies
* Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
* (Embedded) domain specific languages
* New implementation strategies
* Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of
TFP, please contact the TFP 2023 program chair, Stephen Chang.

## Best Paper Awards

TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.

First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best
overall paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.

Second, a prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.
TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new
subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed
as first authors, and a student would present the paper.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the
best paper happens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive
both prizes.


## Instructions to Authors

Papers must be submitted at:

  <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp23>

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions
formally reviewed either before or after the Symposium.
Further, pre-symposium submissions may either be full (earlier deadline)
or draft papers (later deadline).

## Pre-symposium formal review

Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be
submitted before the early deadline and will receive their reviews and
notification of acceptance for both presentation and publication
before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected for publication
but accepted for presentation may be resubmitted for the
post-symposium formal review.


## Post-symposium formal review

Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of
acceptance for presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers
will be invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback receive
at the symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process will then select
a subset of these articles for formal publication.


## Paper categories

Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as
extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (20
pages). The submission must clearly indicate which category it belongs
to: research, position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It
should also indicate which authors are research students, and whether
the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all authors
are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members
shortly after the symposium has taken place.

## Format

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS
style. For more information about formatting please consult the
Springer LNCS web site.
