============== TFP 2022 ===================
== MOVING TO ONLINE SYMPOSIUM, NEW DATES ==
===========================================

23rd Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
17-18 March, 2022
Online event
https://trendsfp.github.io/index.html

Due the pandemic, we have had to make TFP virtual this year. As a
result, we've decided to push back the deadlines and conference date
by a few weeks. In particular, the pre-symposium deadline for
submitting the first version of your paper is now just after the ICFP
deadline.


== Important Dates ==

Submission deadline for draft papers                Monday 7th March, 2022
Notification for draft submissions                  Friday 11th March, 2022
Symposium dates                                     Thursday 17th - Friday 18th March, 2022
Submission deadline for post-symposium reviewing    Wednesday 6th April, 2022
Notification for post-symposium submissions         Friday 27th May, 2022

The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions.



== Scope ==

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various
routes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore
identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles
are solicited in any of these categories:

* Research Articles:
   Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
* Position Articles:
  On what new trends should or should not be
* Project Articles:
   Descriptions of recently started new projects
* Evaluation Articles:
   What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
* Overview Articles:
   Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or
experience-oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques
to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

* Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
* Functional programming in the cloud
* High performance functional computing
* Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
* Dependently typed functional programming
* Validation and verification of functional programs
* Debugging and profiling for functional languages
* Functional programming in different application areas:
   security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
   systems, global computing, grids, etc.
* Interoperability with imperative programming languages
* Novel memory management techniques
* Program analysis and transformation techniques
* Empirical performance studies
* Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
* (Embedded) domain specific languages
* New implementation strategies
* Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of
TFP, please contact the TFP 2022 program chairs, Wouter Swierstra and
Nicolas Wu.


== Best Paper Awards ==

To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best
paper accepted for the formal proceedings.

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new
subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed
as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A prize for
the best student paper is awarded each year.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the
best paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive
both prizes.


== Instructions to Author ==

Papers must be submitted at:

   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp22

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions
formally reviewed either before or after the Symposium.


== Post-symposium formal review process ==

Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of
acceptance for presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers
will be invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback received
at the symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process will then select
a subset of these articles for formal publication.


== Paper categories ==

Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as
extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (20
pages). The submission must clearly indicate which category it belongs
to: research, position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It
should also indicate which authors are research students, and whether
the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all authors
are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members
shortly after the symposium has taken place.


== Format ==

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS
style. For more information about formatting please consult the
Springer LNCS web site.
