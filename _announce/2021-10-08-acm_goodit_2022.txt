ACM International Conference on Information Technology for Social Good
(GoodIT 2022)

7–9 September, 2022, 5* St. Raphael Resort & Marina, Limassol, Cyprus

https://cyprusconferences.org/goodit2022/


Scope

The ACM GoodIT conference seeks papers describing significant research
contributions related to the application of information technologies (IT) to social
good. Social good is typically defined as something that provides a benefit to the 
general public. In this context, clean air and water, Internet connection, education, 
and healthcare are all good examples of social goods. However, new media 
innovations and the explosion of online communities have added new meaning to the
term. Social good is now about global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of 
individuals, technology, and collaboration to create a positive societal impact.

GoodIT solicits papers that address important research challenges related to, but not
limited to:
• Citizen science
• Civic intelligence
• Decentralized approaches to IT
• Digital solutions for Cultural Heritage
• Environmental monitoring
• Ethical computing
• Frugal solutions for IT
• Game, entertainment, and multimedia applications
• Health and social care
• IT for automotive
• IT for development
• IT for education
• T for smart living
• Privacy, trust and ethical issues in ICT solutions
• Smart governance and e-administration
• Social informatics
• Socially responsible IT solutions
• Sustainable cities and transportation
• Sustainable IT
• Technology addressing the digital divide


Special Tracks Proposals

GoodIT 2022 will feature special tracks whose aim is to focus on a specific topic of
interest related to the overall scope of the conference. We solicit proposals for special 
tracks to be held within the main conference and whose publications will be included
in the conference proceedings. Tracks proposals can focus on any contemporary 
themes that highlight social good aspects in the design, implementation,
deployment, securing, and evaluation of IT technologies.  

Special Track Proposal Format
A special track proposal must contain the following information:
• Title of the special track.
• The names of the organizers (indicatively, two) with affiliations, contact
information, and a single paragraph of a brief bio.
• A short description of the scope and topics of the track (max 1/2 page) and a brief
explanation of: (1) why the topic is timely and important; (2) why the topic is related 
to the conference’s main theme; (3) why the track may attract a significant number of
submissions of good quality.
• Indication if a journal special issue is associated with the track, possibly with 
information on the process of selecting papers.
• The plan to disseminate the call for papers of the special track for achieving a 
reasonable number of paper submissions (a list of emailing lists will help).
• A tentative Program Committee list.
• A draft Call for Papers (max 1 page).

Publication
Papers submitted to each particular track have to satisfy the same criteria as for the 
main conference. They must be original works and must not have been previously 
published. They have to be peer-reviewed by the track's Program Committee (at least
three reviews per submitted paper are required). The final version of papers must 
follow the formatting instructions of the main conference
(https://cyprusconferences.org/goodit2022/index.php/authors/). At least one of the 
authors of all accepted papers must register and present the work at the conference;
otherwise, the paper will not be published in the proceedings. All accepted and 
presented papers will be included in the conference proceedings published in the
ACM Digital Library. The special track may provide an option for publishing extended
versions of selected papers in a special issue of a journal.  

Special Track Proposal Submission Guidelines
Special track proposals should be submitted as a single PDF file to the special track 
Chairs (see below) via email  to: ombretta.gaggi@unipd.it, valentino.vranic@stuba.sk, 
and rysavy@fit.vut.cz. The subject of the e-mail must be: “GoodIT 2022 – special
track proposal”. The special track chairs may ask proposers for supplying additional 
information during the review period. 


Main Track Paper Submission

The papers should not exceed six (6) pages (US letter size) double-column,
including figures, tables, and references in standard ACM format
(https://cyprusconferences.org/goodit2022/index.php/authors/).

They must be original works and must not have been previously published.

At least one of the authors of all accepted papers must register and present the
work at the conference; otherwise, the paper will not be published in the
proceedings. All accepted and presented papers will be included in the conference
proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library.

Special journal issues will be organised where the best accepted papers will be invited
to submit extended versions.

Separate call-for-papers will be announced for the special tracks (more information
will be available on the conference web site).


Work-in-Progress and PhD Track

Inside ACM GoodIT, the Work-in-Progress and PhD Track provides an opportunity to
showcase interesting new work that is still at an early stage. We encourage 
practitioners and researchers to submit to the Work-in-Progress venue as it provides
a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting feedback on early-stage 
work, and fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues. Moreover, this 
track provides a platform for PhD students to present and receive feedback on their 
ongoing research. Students at different stages of their research will have the
opportunity to present and discuss their research questions, goals, methods and 
results. This is an opportunity to obtain guidance on various aspects of their research
from established researchers and other PhD students working in research areas 
related to technologies for social good.

Important: For this specific track, papers must not exceed four (4) pages
(US letter size) double column, including figures, tables, and references in standard
ACM format (https://cyprusconferences.org/goodit2022/index.php/authors/).
