===================
2025 ACM SIGMETRICS
Call for Tutorials
===================

June 9-13, 2025
Stony Brook University, New York, USA

Overview
========

The 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference seeks tutorial proposals, which should provide clear and focused teaching material within the scope of the conference. The list of topics can be found under the conference call:

https://www.sigmetrics.org/sigmetrics2025/call_for_papers.html

Introductory tutorials (on key analytical tools, measurement methodologies, problem areas, etc.) as well as tutorials covering new and emerging topics that are of broad interest to students, academics, and practitioners are particularly encouraged. We will also be open to receiving proposals on the topics that are adjacent to the traditional focus of the conference. The length of the tutorial can be 1.5 hours or 3 hours.

The tutorial proposal should describe concisely the content, importance, and timeliness of the tutorial. It should contain the following sections:

- Title of tutorial.
- Preferred length (1.5 hours/3 hours). (Note: Final length will be determined based on received proposals and available slots.)
- The name(s) of the tutorial lecturer(s).
- Tutorial abstract.
- Tutorial outline. If there is more than one speaker, the distribution of the tutorial content among the lecturers should be roughly described.
- Importance and timeliness of the tutorial.
- Biography for each tutorial lecturer (no more than 300 words per person, including previous lecture and tutorial experience).

ALL speakers of an accepted proposal are expected to participate in conducting the tutorial. For collaborative work, only the contributors conducting the tutorial should be listed as “speakers”. An honorarium will be provided for each tutorial to at least cover the registration cost of a speaker.
