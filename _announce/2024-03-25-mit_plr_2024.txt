Come join us for this year's MIT Programming Languages Review workshop on May 4th! Registration is now open: https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dlZXiXeYScmhc9M

The MIT PLR is a student-run committee that aims to highlight recent developments that we believe have significant potential to shape the future direction of PL research and/or industry practice. We aim to select papers that may substantially transform the PL community and beyond, with a focus on emerging trends rather than established lines of research. 

Stay tuned for our full program details and selected papers here: http://plr.csail.mit.edu/

To get a sense of what this year might offer, take a look at last year's program here: https://plr.csail.mit.edu/plr2023.html

We hope to see you there!
