The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at SPLASH 2023 is looking for students who are interested in programming languages and software engineering research to apply! The workshop is aimed at late-stage undergraduates interested in graduate school, as well as early-career Masters/PhD students. 

A key mission of this workshop is to increase the diversity of students who apply to (and, crucially, remain in) PhD programs. This workshop will provide mentoring sessions on how to prepare for and thrive in graduate school and in a research career, focusing both on cutting-edge research topics and practical advice. The workshop will show students the many paths that they might take to enter and contribute to our research community.

Students who are interested in attending the workshop and would like to request funding to do so must fill out a short application (due by July 24 AOE for full consideration). 

PLMW highly encourages applicants from first time conference attendees and members of underrepresented groups in computing.
