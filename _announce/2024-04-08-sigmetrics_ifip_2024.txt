Dear SIGPLAN Members,

Registration is now open for ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance 2024,
held June 10-14, 2024, at San Servolo Congress Center, Venice, Italy. 
SIGMETRICS and Performance are respectively the flagship conferences 
of the ACM special interest group for the computer systems performance 
evaluation community and of the IFIP working group WG7.3 on 
performance modeling and analysis. Every 3 years or so, the two 
conferences join, and this is the 16th joint conference. We also 
celebrate the 50th ACM SIGMETRICS conference.
