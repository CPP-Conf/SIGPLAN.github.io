The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international 
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional programming, 
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to 
be a lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and other 
contributions.

This year, TFP will take place in-person at Seton Hall University, in South 
Orange, NJ in the United States. It is co-located with the Trends in Functional 
Programming in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will take on the day before 
the main symposium.

Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, November 4, 
is for authors that wish to have their full paper reviewed prior to the symposium. 
Papers that are accepted in this way must also be presented at the symposium. The 
second, November 30, is for authors that wish to present their work or work-in 
progress at the symposium first without submitting to the full review process for 
publication. These authors can then take into account feedback received at the 
symposium and submit a full article for review by the third deadline, February 23.

## Scope

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes. As part 
of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following five article 
categories. High-quality articles are solicited in any of these categories:

* Research Articles:
  Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
* Position Articles:
  On what new trends should or should not be
* Project Articles:
  Descriptions of recently started new projects
* Evaluation Articles:
  What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
* Overview Articles:
  Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication to any 
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: theoretical, 
implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of functional 
programming techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

* Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
* Functional programming in the cloud
* High performance functional computing
* Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
* Dependently typed functional programming
* Validation and verification of functional programs
* Debugging and profiling for functional languages
* Functional programming in different application areas:
  security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
  systems, global computing, grids, etc.
* Interoperability with imperative programming languages
* Novel memory management techniques
* Program analysis and transformation techniques
* Empirical performance studies
* Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
* (Embedded) domain specific languages
* New implementation strategies
* Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, please contact 
the TFP 2024 program chair, Jason Hemann.

## Best Paper Awards

TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.

First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best overall paper 
accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.

Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. TFP traditionally 
pays special attention to research students, acknowledging that students are almost by 
definition part of new subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors 
state that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are the paperâ€™s first 
authors, and a student would present the paper.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the best paper happens 
to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.


## Instructions to Authors

Authors must submit papers to:

  <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp24>

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally reviewed either 
before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium submissions may either be full 
(earlier deadline) or draft papers (later deadline).


## Pre-symposium formal review

Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted before the early 
deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of acceptance for both presentation 
and publication before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected for publication but 
accepted for presentation may be resubmitted for the post-symposium formal review.


## Post-symposium formal review

Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance for presentation at 
the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised papers based on the 
feedback receive at the symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process will then select a 
subset of these articles for formal publication.


## Paper categories

Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as extended abstracts (4 to 
10 pages in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must clearly indicate which 
category it belongs to: research, position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It should 
also indicate which authors are research students, and whether the main author(s) are students. 
A draft paper for which all authors are students will receive additional feedback by one of the 
PC members shortly after the symposium has taken place.


## Format

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For more information about 
formatting please consult the Springer LNCS Guidelines web site:
