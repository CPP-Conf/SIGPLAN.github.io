===================
2025 ACM SIGMETRICS
===================

June 9-13, 2025
Stony Brook University, New York, USA

Overview
=======

We solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation. The research may target systems in a broad range of domains, including networking, high-performance computing, machine learning, IoT, cloud, edge, multimedia, mobile, and cyber-physical systems. The work may target diverse system metrics such as latency, throughput, reliability, cost, accuracy, fairness, energy, and carbon footprint.

The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Awards and the Stephen S. Lavenberg and Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Awards. Additionally, a selection of the accepted papers, as identified by a panel of reviewers, may be nominated for publication as Research Highlights in the Communications of the ACM (CACM).

Important dates
============

There are three submission opportunities over the course of the year.

Summer submission website: sigmetrics25summer.hotcrp.com
- Registration of abstract: July 31, 2024
- Paper submission: August 7, 2024
- Author notification: September 24, 2024

Fall submission website: sigmetrics25fall.hotcrp.com
- Registration of abstract: October 2, 2024
- Paper submission: October 9, 2024
- Author notification: December 10, 2024

Winter submission website: sigmetrics25winter.hotcrp.com
- Registration of abstract: January 15, 2025
- Paper submission: January 22, 2025
- Author notification: March 18, 2025

Deadlines are hard and at 23:59pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

Papers may be submitted to any deadline and, upon acceptance, papers will be scheduled for publication in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS) and presentation at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.
