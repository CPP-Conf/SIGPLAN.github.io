Dear colleagues,

We would like to remind you about the early Nov 15 deadline for submitting proposals for 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS tutorials in Long Island New York next June 9-13. Introductory tutorials (on key analytical tools, measurement methodologies, problem areas, etc.) as well as tutorials covering new and emerging topics that are of broad interest to students, academics, and practitioners are particularly encouraged. We are also open to receiving proposals on the topics that are adjacent to the traditional focus of the conference.

See the formal call for proposals here: https://www.sigmetrics.org/sigmetrics2025/tutorials.html

Sincerely,

CÃ©line Comte
2025 SIGMETRICS Publicity co-chair

On behalf of Ting He and Christina Lee Yu
2025 SIGMETRICS Tutorial co-chairs
