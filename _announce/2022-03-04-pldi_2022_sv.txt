Sign up to be a Student Volunteer (SV) and help us make PLDI 2022 a unique experience for all attendants!

PLDI 2022 is pleased to offer a number of opportunities for student volunteers, who are vital to the efficient operation and continued success of the conference each year. The student volunteer program is a chance for students from around the world to participate in the conference whilst assisting us in preparing and running the event. In exchange for a fixed number of work hours (usually from 12 to 15) helping with the conference organization, you will be able to closely interact with researchers, mentors, and other students at PLDI 2022.

You will be able to support us in-person or virtually. We are looking forward to seeing you in the SV team!
