The 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Managed
Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang,
originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing
novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and
runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the
most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale
(embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing
and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile,
IoT, and wearable applications).

This year, MPLR will be held as a hybrid event with in-person
participation at Münster, Germany and online participation.
