CONCUR 2024: Call for Papers
============================

September 9-13, 2024
Calgary, Canada

Co-located with QEST+Formats as part of CONFEST 2024

Overview
========

CONCUR conferences bring together researchers, developers, and 
students interested in advancing the theory of concurrency, and its 
applications. CONCUR 2024 solicits high quality papers reporting 
research results and/or experience related to semantics, logics, 
verification and analysis of concurrent systems. 

Important dates 
===============

Topics
======
Submissions are solicited in the theory and practice of concurrent 
systems. The principal topics include (but are not limited to):

-- Basic models of concurrency such as abstract machines, 
domain-theoretic models, categorical and coalgebraic models, 
game-theoretic models, process algebras, graph transformation 
systems, Petri nets, hybrid systems, mobile and collaborative 
systems, probabilistic systems, real-time systems, quantum systems, 
biology-inspired systems, and synchronous systems;

-- Logics for concurrency such as modal logics, program logics, 
probabilistic and stochastic logics, temporal logics, and resource 
logics;

-- Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems such 
as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race 
detection, pre-order and equivalence checking, run-time verification, 
state-space exploration, static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem 
proving, type systems, and security analysis;

-- Distributed algorithms and data structures: design, analysis, 
complexity, correctness, fault tolerance, reliability, availability, 
consistency, self-organization, self-stabilization, protocols;

-- Theoretical foundations, tools, and empirical evaluations of 
architectures, execution environments, and software development for 
concurrent systems such as geo-replicated systems, communication 
networks, multiprocessor and multi-core architectures, shared and 
transactional memory, resource management and awareness, compilers 
and tools for concurrent programming, programming models such as 
component-based, object- and service-oriented.

Paper Submission
================

-- All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for 
publication elsewhere. 

-- Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. The paper may 
be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed 
at the discretion of the program committee.

-- The CONCUR 2024 proceedings will be published by LIPIcs. Papers 
must be submitted electronically as PDF files via HotCRP. 

https://concur2024.hotcrp.com/

-- Submissions follow a light double blind process. Papers must not 
exceed 14 pages (excluding references and clearly marked appendices) 
using the LIPIcs style.

Awards
======

In 2024, CONCUR Test-of-Time and best paper awards will be given for 
the fourth time. The winners will be announced at the conference.
