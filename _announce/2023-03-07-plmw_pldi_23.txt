The application for attending the Programming Language Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) @PLDI 2023 is open. The deadline is March 20th. Please encourage undergraduates, MS students, and junior PhD students that you think could benefit from the workshop to apply. The application link is here https://forms.gle/fgVCtySumxzFqwpaA. Below is more information about PLMW@PLDI 2023.

PLMW aims to broaden the exposure of late-stage undergraduate students and early-stage graduate students to research and career opportunities in programming languages. The workshop includes mentoring sessions that cover effective habits for navigating research careers, technical sessions that cover core subfields of programming languages research, and social sessions that create opportunities for students to interact with researchers in the field. Applications from underrepresented groups in computing are especially welcome.

PLMW @ PLDI 2023 will be co-located with the conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation. It will be held on June 18, 2023. The workshop program will cover important topics such as:

How to excel in graduate school and after graduate school
How to give a good research talk
Overviews of key research areas at PLDI
