title: "New Leadership at SIGPLAN-M"
---
Two years ago, [Talia Ringer][] launched the SIGPLAN long-term mentoring
program, [SIGPLAN-M][]. It has been extremely well received, with the number
of mentors and mentees quickly growing.

The time has come to create a rotation structure for the leadership of the
program. [Nadia Polikarpova][] will take over as SIGPLAN-M chair.

Many thanks to both Talia and Nadia!
