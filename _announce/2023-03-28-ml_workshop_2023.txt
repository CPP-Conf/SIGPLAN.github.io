Higher-order, Typed, Inferred, Strict: ACM SIGPLAN ML Family Workshop
September 8, 2023 (Friday) Seattle, WA, USA (day after main ICFP)

Call for presentations: https://icfp23.sigplan.org/home/mlworkshop-2023

ML Family Workshop is an established informal workshop aiming to
recognize the entire extended ML family and to provide the forum to
present and discuss common issues: all aspects of the design,
semantics, theory, application, implementation, and teaching of the
members of the ML family. We also encourage presentations from related
languages (such as Haskell, Scala, Rust, Nemerle, Links, Koka, F*,
Eff, ATS, etc), to promote the exchange of ideas and experience.  The
ML family workshop will be held in close coordination with the OCaml
Users and Developers Workshop.

We plan the workshop to an be in-person event with remote participation
(streamed live).  Speakers are generally expected to present in person
(we will work to make remote presentations possible).

We solicit proposals for contributed talks, in PDF format, with a
short summary at the beginning and the indication of the submission
category: Research Presentations, Experience Reports, Demos, and
Informed Positions. The point of the submission should be clear from
its first two pages (PC members are not obligated to read any
further.) We particularly encourage talks about works in progress,
presentations of negative results (things that were expected to but
did not quite work out) and informed positions.

* Deadline for talk proposals: ** Thursday June 1, 2023 **
* Notification of acceptance:  ** Thursday July 6, 2023 **
* Workshop:                    ** Friday September 8, 2023 **
