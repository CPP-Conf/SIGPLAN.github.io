Eelco Visser Commemorative Symposium (EVCS)
5 April 2023
Delft, The Netherlands
https://symposium.eelcovisser.org

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eelco Visser (1966–2022) was Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Professor of Computer Science and Chair of the Programming Languages Group in the Department of Software Technology at TU Delft. His research career started with studies at the University of Amsterdam and CWI, followed by appointments at Oregon Graduate Institute and Utrecht University. He was highly influential in the software language engineering and programming language design communities. His many scientific contributions about meta-languages and domain-specific languages have been of high importance in both the scientific and industrial communities. He was a founding member of IFIP Working Groups 2.11 (Program Generation) and 2.16 (Programming Language Design).

Eelco Visser’s work on the cutting-edge language workbench Spoofax started with a ground-breaking publication in 2010, for which he received a Most Influential Paper award at OOPSLA 2020. As a strong advocate of tool-supported programming education, he led the development of WebLab, a learning management system that is in use for a range of programming languages and courses at TU Delft. He also led the design, implementation and use of conf.researchr.org, a content management system for scientific events used by hundreds of international events since 2011.
