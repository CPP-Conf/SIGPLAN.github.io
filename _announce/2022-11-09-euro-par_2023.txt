29th International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing
(Euro-Par 2023)

August 28 - September 1, 2023, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://2023.euro-par.org


SCOPE

Euro-Par is the prime European conference covering all aspects of parallel and
distributed processing, ranging from theory to practice, from small to the largest
parallel and distributed systems and infrastructures, from fundamental
computational problems to applications, from architecture, compiler, language and
interface design and implementation, to tools, support infrastructures, and
application performance aspects. The main audience of Euro-Par are researchers in
academic institutions, government laboratories and industrial organisations.
Euro-Par aims to be the primary choice of such professionals for the presentation of
new results in their specific areas. Euro-Par provides an excellent forum for focused
technical discussion, as well as interaction with a large, broad and diverse audience.
In addition, Euro-Par conferences provide a platform for a number of accompanying,
technical workshops for smaller and emerging communities. 


VENUE AND ORGANIZATION

Euro-Par 2023 will be held as a primarily in-person event (although remote
presentation and participation will be supported, if needed). The venue place is
the 5* St. Raphael Resort, in Limassol, Cyprus. Euro-Par 2023 is organised by the
Department of Computer Science of the University of Cyprus. The General Chair
is George A. Papadopoulos and the Program Chairs are Marios D. Dikaiakos and 
Rizos Sakellariou. The Organizing Committee is listed on the web site:
